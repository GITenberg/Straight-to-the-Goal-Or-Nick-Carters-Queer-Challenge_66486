<h1>STRAIGHT TO THE GOAL;
<br />
<small>Or, NICK CARTER’S QUEER CHALLENGE.</small></h1>

<p class="no-indent center p1">Edited by CHICKERING CARTER.</p>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.
<br />
<small>THE MESSAGE OF THE SPEAR.</small></h2>


<p>A spear shot into the midst of the camp, and stuck,
quivering, in the ground!</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan and Chick jumped to their feet, rifle in
hand, and looked inquiringly at Nick Carter.</p>

<p>The detective had not moved. He was sitting with his
back against a rock, a cigar in his mouth, and silently
contemplating the small fire that he had consented to have
made.</p>

<p>When the spear came sailing over the bluff, at the
foot of which was the little camp, he merely glanced
at it, as if it were a rather curious visitor, but not one to
cause untoward agitation.</p>

<p>There were other persons around the camp fire besides
Nick Carter and his two assistants.</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold, the millionaire shipowner of New
York and Calcutta; Jai Singh, the high-caste Hindu, who
had proved himself so valuable an ally to Nick Carter,
and Adil, also an East Indian, the body servant of Jefferson
Arnold’s son, Leslie, all were sitting there.</p>

<p>The men started up when the spear came sailing over
the rocks and buried its heavy metal head in the ground
just before them.</p>

<p>“That thing might have hit some of us,” cried Jefferson
Arnold. “Better look out! There may be others.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” was Nick Carter’s calm response.
“That is a message only, unless I am much mistaken.
Don’t you see there is something tied around the wooden
shaft just below the head. Looks like a bit of cloth.”</p>

<p>He stepped forward, and, with a sharp tug, drew the
spear from the hard earth. Then he unwound from it a
silk necktie of a rather unusual pattern.</p>

<p>“It is Leslie’s!” shouted Jefferson Arnold wildly, as he
held out his hand for the tie. “I never saw one like it
except on my son. He had it on when we were in that
city yonder.”</p>

<p>“I remember it,” answered Nick, looking at the curious
combination of colors thoughtfully. “It struck me as
unique, and yet in perfect taste. Still, probably there are
others like it in the world.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But it isn’t likely others would have these
initials embroidered on the back of it,” rejoined Jefferson.
“See! ‘L.A.’ No, Carter, this is my boy’s necktie,
and he is in the hands of those rapscallions over there.”</p>

<p>The father buried his face in his hands, and rocked to
and fro convulsively.</p>

<p>“Well, even so, what is the meaning of the spear coming
over the rocks like this?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“There can be only one meaning,” returned Nick Carter.
“Calaman, the high priest of that strange city,
Shangore, sends us this necktie to let us know he has
Leslie Arnold a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Why did we ever come away without making sure he
was safe?” groaned Jefferson Arnold. “It was my fault.
My boy will think we have deserted him.”</p>

<p>“No,” contradicted Nick. “He will know better than
that. He will understand just how it was. In the darkness,
when we escaped from that city, we thought he was
with us. You will remember we had quite a tussle on
the drawbridge, and got off only just in time. It looks
now as if Leslie must have been caught when they pulled
up the bridge.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” assented the millionaire. “But what are
we going to do?” he wailed. “What do you suppose this
message means? Do you think the necktie was sent just
to taunt us?”</p>

<p>The agony of this usually self-contained man was pitiful.</p>

<p>An answer came in an unexpected way at this moment.
Another spear dropped upon the rocks a little way
off and lay flat. It had not been so skillfully discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as the first one, but it also bore its message—this time in
writing.</p>

<p>The characters were more like those of ancient Greece
than the letters used by English-speaking people to-day,
and the spelling was phonetic. But it was possible to
make them out, with a little study.</p>

<p>“This says ‘You are all invited to Shangore,’” announced
Nick Carter, after examining the note for a few minutes.
“Here is a small sketch of the head and face of
Calaman in the corner. In lieu of a signature, I suppose.
It is written on some kind of parchment. Probably
the people of Shangore have not mastered the art of
making paper.”</p>

<p>“Many letters are written on skin of this kind,” remarked
Jai Singh quietly, as he took the scrap of material from
Nick Carter’s hand and rubbed it between his fingers.
“And yet paper is made in many parts of India, too.”</p>

<p>“That is all unimportant,” interrupted Jefferson Arnold
impatiently. “What are we going to do about it? How
are we going to save my boy?”</p>

<p>“What do you want to do?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Go,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” put in Patsy. “If Leslie is in that
heathen city, we’ve got to get him out.”</p>

<p>“It may mean death, remember, Patsy!” suggested Nick
Carter.</p>

<p>His impulsive young assistant actually jumped in the
air and cracked his heels together, as one of his ancestors
might have done at Donnybrook Fair, generations before,
when a challenge was thrown out to them.</p>

<p>“What do we care for that?” howled Patsy. “We’ll
make it hot for them first. Anyhow, I don’t think it
would mean death or anything like that. But we’ve got to
get Leslie Arnold.”</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold reached across to shake hands with
Patsy.</p>

<p>“Well, let us look over the situation dispassionately
before we take action,” suggested Nick. “We cannot
hide from ourselves that Calaman is a cunning and
powerful personage, and that his control of the people
of that city, where they worship the Golden Scarab, is
complete.”</p>

<p>“I just want to get my fingers on that old geezer’s throat
if he has hurt Leslie,” muttered Patsy.</p>

<p>“When we went into Shangore yesterday with Calaman
and his guards, it was as his guest,” continued Nick. “We
found the rascal Pike, who had stolen a hundred thousand
dollars from the Arnold Company in Calcutta, and
who had taken refuge in Shangore, because he did not
think any one could trace him there.”</p>

<p>“That was reasonable enough for him to think,” commented
Chick. “Shangore, the capital city of Bolongu, is
right over here, in the Himalayas, in a region where few
white men have penetrated in many centuries.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe any have been here till now,” put in
Jai Singh, as he looked up from polishing his spearhead
with a cloth he had taken from his garments. “At least,
not for more than two or three hundred years.”</p>

<p>“That’s as it may be,” observed Nick Carter. “Anyhow,
we all know that it was the intention of Calaman to hold
us as prisoners, and perhaps to kill us all eventually. That
was why we got out.”</p>

<p>“The only thing there was for us to do,” growled Jefferson
Arnold.</p>

<p>“Now he is trying to entice us in again,” said Chick.
“How do we know Leslie Arnold is in the city?”</p>

<p>“Here is his necktie, sent over to us on a spear,” Nick
reminded him.</p>

<p>“Well, what of that? Leslie may have dropped it.”</p>

<p>“No,” interposed Jefferson Arnold. “I saw that necktie
tightly knotted around his neck as we came over the drawbridge.
It could not have come off accidentally. The
only way old Calaman could have got hold of it was by
having it taken from the boy’s neck. Leslie is a prisoner
in Shangore.”</p>

<p>“That is my reading of it,” agreed Nick Carter. “We
shall have to go and get him out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we’re going to do that, even if we get
into the city,” remarked Jai Singh. “Those thick walls
and the gates that no one can pass must be kept in
mind.”</p>

<p>Arnold looked at the tall, dignified Hindu resentfully.</p>

<p>“What are you croaking about, Jai Singh? It isn’t like
you to hold back when there is to be some fighting. Why
do you oppose our going back to Shangore?”</p>

<p>“I do not oppose it, sahib,” replied Jai Singh, with dignity.
“I need not tell that I am ready to fight. My spear
is sharp and my arm strong. Besides, I have learned to
use the revolver I carry in my sash. But I know of the
danger that is behind the walls of Shangore, and it is not
well that you should forget it, either.”</p>

<p>“We do not forget it,” put in Nick Carter. “But we
have to bring Leslie Arnold away, and we must take whatever
risks there are. Jai Singh, will you make them
understand that we will go back?”</p>

<p>Jai Singh bowed in acquiescence, and, picking up his
spear, was about to go down the pass through the rocks
that led to the valley, on the opposite side of which the
towers and roofs of Shangore glistened in the early-morning
sun.</p>

<p>“Wait,” ordered Nick. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To the cliff beyond, where the men in the valley can
see me.”</p>

<p>“I understand. You will give them a sign that they
will understand. Well, tell them we will come at once.”</p>

<p>Jai Singh bowed again, and disappeared, while Nick Carter
turned to give a few last words of advice to those
with him.</p>

<p>“We have been here all night,” he began, “and we are
rested. We have had a good breakfast, and are strong
enough to fight.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” threw in Patsy Garvan energetically.</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely we shall be called on to do anything
of the kind at first,” went on Nick. “But we shall have
to use our brains if we are to come through this enterprise
in safety, and also bring Leslie Arnold with us.”</p>

<p>“We put a lot of their soldiers out of business in that
scrap we had with them last night,” observed Chick. “It
would be bad if Calaman decided to revenge himself upon
us for their loss.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” put in Adil, the young Hindu, speaking
for the first time. “Calaman thinks nothing of the
lives of his men. As he has said to us, they are his
slaves, and he can do what he likes with them. He may be
sorry to lose their services, but he never would think of
avenging them. They are not important enough, in his
eyes.”</p>

<p>“There’s truth in that, Adil,” assented Nick Carter. “We
have seen how he caused the death of one of his guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
just because he stumbled and dropped a package he was
carrying. No, I dare say he will pretend to be friendly
with us, as if there never had been a fight.”</p>

<p>“He’s a sly old rascal,” snorted Jefferson Arnold. “But
we’ll beat him yet. We’ve got to do it. We shall be taking
a big chance going into that walled city of his, but I’ve
got to save my boy, at any risk.”</p>

<p>“We will start,” announced Nick Carter. “Jai Singh
has delivered our answer by this time.”</p>

<p>There was no particular preparation required before
they went on. The rifles they had laid by their sides
were picked up, and the few fragments of biscuits that
had not been devoured were placed in their pockets with
the whole ones that Nick Carter’s forethought had caused
them all to carry with them.</p>

<p>“We have no ammunition,” observed Nick. “But we
must get hold of some of those cartridges of ours that
they took from us as soon as we are well within Shangore.
I will get the old fellow to let me show him how we use
these ‘death sticks,’ as he calls them.”</p>

<p>They marched through the crooked pass between the
towering walls of rocks, and came suddenly upon Jai
Singh, who was waving his spear about so that a number
of men who stood in the valley, looking up, could see
his movements without difficulty.</p>

<p>“I have told them,” said Jai Singh coolly. “We can
go down at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Jai Singh,” returned the detective. “Come
on, everybody. And remember, Patsy,” he added to his
second assistant, “I will do the talking.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>SHARPSHOOTING.</small></h2>


<p>When they walked across the drawbridge at the nearest
of the four great gates of the city, and passed under the
portcullis, escorted by a dozen of the guards of the high
priest Calaman, the latter came forward with a smile and
bade them welcome.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the limit?” muttered Patsy. “Any one would
think we were friends of his.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter gave Patsy a warning look, and addressed
Calaman in calm, firm tones:</p>

<p>“Whether we are welcome or not, Calaman, is not of so
much importance as to know whether you are prepared
to deliver to us the white man you have in Shangore.”</p>

<p>“My son!” broke in Jefferson Arnold. “That’s whom we
want.”</p>

<p>Calaman held up his hands with a deprecating gesture,
as he smiled.</p>

<p>“My white brothers might know that I would not ask
them to come back unless I had something to offer that
would please them,” he exclaimed. “We did not understand
each other before, and that was why there was
fighting and death, when all I desired was peace and good
feeling.”</p>

<p>“Old liar!” murmured Chick.</p>

<p>“Your former apartments in the palace are ready for
you,” continued the priest. “Will you honor me by taking
possession? I will send you food and wine. You need
them after your journey. After that, we will go to the
public square.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“This is the day of the Festival of the Golden Scarab,”
was the reply. “We ask you to take part in the celebration
by showing us again how the death sticks do their
work. Will you not do it?”</p>

<p>“Where is the white man we want—he who is the son
of my friend, here?”</p>

<p>Nick Carter was resolved not to be turned aside from
the main purpose of their coming, persistently as the wily
priest endeavored to lead the conversation into other
channels.</p>

<p>“He shall be delivered to you in good time,” answered
Calaman. “In the meanwhile, you have my assurance that
he is well and enjoying treatment such as you would
desire.”</p>

<p>They had to be content with this for the time being.</p>

<p>“We shall be ready in half an hour,” Nick Carter announced
abruptly, as he walked away to the apartments
they had occupied before.</p>

<p>Calaman was as good as his word in reference to the
meal he had mentioned, and though they had had a frugal
breakfast already up in the rocks, they were quite willing
to attack the well-served repast provided for them now.</p>

<p>In exactly half an hour two soldiers came to the door
and made deep salaams.</p>

<p>“Very well!” was Nick Carter’s response to this silent
notification. “Lead on!”</p>

<p>As they filed out of the room, Chick remarked, in a low
tone, as he glanced back at the remains of the meal on
the table:</p>

<p>“We’ve got to hand it to the old man for the square
meal he puts up. I don’t know what we’ve been eating,
but it was as good as anything I ever got in New York.”</p>

<p>Jai Singh snorted rather derisively.</p>

<p>“In my part of the country,” he boomed, “when we feed
guests, we provide fat sheep, which are roasted over a very
hot fire, and put before those who eat, with rice, raisins,
and many fruits that are gathered for the occasion.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if these people intend us to be the
sheep this time,” smiled Nick Carter. “They intend to
roast us over a hot fire—if we let them.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chuckled Patsy. “If we let them. Gee!
There’s going to be a hot time in their old town to-day,
and we’ll be fixing the fire.”</p>

<p>Nothing could repress Patsy Garvan’s bubbling spirits
at the prospect of a battle. He liked fighting for its own
sake.</p>

<p>The possibility of his being beaten never occurred to
Patsy. That was the reason he was nearly always on
the winning side.</p>

<p>The two tall guards, carrying their spears in military
fashion, and never looking behind, were several yards in
front. Nick Carter turned and addressed all the members
of his little band:</p>

<p>“Don’t overlook the odds against us. Our four coolies—who
could be depended on to keep up their end in a
mêlée when told to drive ahead—are prisoners somewhere
in this place. Then Calaman has all our cartridges. We
can’t do much for ourselves or for Leslie till we get hold
of our ammunition.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get it,” declared Patsy, with his usual confidence.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do it,” added Chick. “We are inside the
walls of Shangore, and there is nothing for us but to
fight. We got out before, and we can do it again. But,
as you say, chief, we must find the cartridges.”</p>

<p>When they reached the courtyard of the palace, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
found Calaman waiting for them, surrounded by more
than a score of his saturnine guards.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you have brought your death sticks
with you,” was the priest’s greeting. “We will go to the
public square, where you may show me again how the
sticks kill at a distance.”</p>

<p>They marched through the streets of the city, and the
white men were struck by the large numbers of people who
were moving about, evidently in holiday dress.</p>

<p>Their garments were all of Eastern style, of course, but
there was so many different cloths, cut into such varied
designs, that Nick Carter told himself he had never seen
a more striking sartorial display even on Fifth Avenue
on a bright afternoon.</p>

<p>“You will not kill men for me with your stick, I suppose?”
asked the priest, rather wistfully. “I could have
three or four of them tied to those stakes over there,
and your death sticks could be tried on them.”</p>

<p>This cold-blooded suggestion made Patsy grind his teeth.</p>

<p>Nick Carter shook his head, and answered that he certainly
could not consent to do murder in that way.</p>

<p>“Well, I felt sure of that,” returned the priest. “So I
have something else for you. Look!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter shuddered as he gazed at the gruesome object
at which Calaman pointed.</p>

<p>Between two stakes driven into the ground was strung
a long rope. In the middle of the rope was a cord hanging
down a little way, and on the end of it was the
shriveled head of a human being.</p>

<p>The head had been embalmed, dried, and treated in
the secret way known to the people of this strange country,
and was not bigger than a good-sized orange.</p>

<p>There it hung, swaying gently to and fro in the slight
breeze, occasionally spinning around, as if it were inspecting
everything in the square in its own mysterious, grim
way.</p>

<p>“Can you hit that with your death stick?” asked the
priest.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was Nick’s prompt reply.</p>

<p>“Even while it moves a little?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I wouldn’t have said that,” grumbled Patsy, in
a low tone. “You might as well have had it as easy as
you could get it.”</p>

<p>“Then let my white brothers raise their sticks and do
it,” directed Calaman, stepping back a little.</p>

<p>“One moment!” called out the detective. “Before we
can use our sticks, we must have those little brass cases
that you took from us when we were here before.”</p>

<p>Two of the heavy boxes containing cartridges which
had come into possession of the priest when Nick and
his party had been in the city on the previous day were
on the ground, and Nick had seen them.</p>

<p>“Break open that box!” ordered Calaman, pointing to
the one he meant.</p>

<p>One of the guards, with his spear, pried off the lid. Nick
Carter at once took one of the smaller boxes in the outer
case and stuffed it into one of his outside pockets.</p>

<p>The small box contained two hundred and fifty cartridges.</p>

<p>“Get some!” he directed his comrades laconically.</p>

<p>Chick, Patsy, Jefferson Arnold, Adil, and Jai Singh
all obeyed. Each was soon well supplied with cartridges,
while the big box was practically empty.</p>

<p>Calaman regarded them suspiciously as they grabbed the
cartridges. But he did not say anything. Doubtless he
felt that he had the whole party in his power, and he
could afford to let them have all of these little brass
things they wanted.</p>

<p>“First trick to us!” mumbled Jefferson. “And my rifle
magazine is plumb full, as well. We’ll make the old scalawag
sit up before we’re through with him. Let ’er go,
Carter!”</p>

<p>The detective dropped to one knee, and seemingly without
taking careful aim, sent three shots at the swinging
head.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p>Every bullet had struck the head and was embedded in
it. The process of drying and embalming had given it a
toughness which permitted the bullets to sink in, without
cracking or destroying its shape.</p>

<p>“Holy mackerel!” muttered Patsy Garvan. “That’s a
sickening thing. But the chief plugged it, all the same.”</p>

<p>The detective got up and brushed his knee with his
hand.</p>

<p>“Go and see for yourself,” he said to the priest. “I
have used three of these little cases, and you will find
a bit of lead in that skull for each one. Had three of
your guards been standing there, I could have killed them
as easily as I hit that head.”</p>

<p>Calaman, accompanied by two of his guards, walked
across the open space to the swinging head—it was rather
more than two hundred yards from where Nick Carter had
stood to shoot—and examined it closely.</p>

<p>The three bullets were there. The priest could see them
plainly. There had been no deception by the white man
with the death stick.</p>

<p>“Stay there, Calaman!” called out Nick. “Stand three
paces to the right of the head, and watch. The death
sticks will do more than you have already seen.”</p>

<p>The priest did as he was told, with a wondering expression
in his deep-set dark eyes. The detective turned
to Chick, and spoke in low, earnest tones:</p>

<p>“Blaze away at it, Chick. And be sure to hit it squarely
in the middle, if you can.”</p>

<p>“I can do it,” replied Chick. “I’ll drive my first bullet
farther in with two others. How will that do?”</p>

<p>“Capital, if you can manage it. I want to teach that
old heathen a lesson that will make him wonder where it is
going to stop.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter was pumping fresh cartridges into his own
magazine as he spoke. There should be no chance of his
being caught with an unloaded rifle while he had ammunition
within reach, at all events.</p>

<p>“I can manage it,” grunted Chick, as he took careful
aim. “I’m glad I’ve always kept up swinging-target practice.
At some of those shooting galleries in New York
they have me barred out,” he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment!” roared Calaman. “I’ll come away
while you are using your death sticks. They might go
the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“There’s no danger if you don’t move,” Nick Carter
called back to him. “Tell your guards to keep away.”
Then, to Chick: “Now, old man, show them what you
have.”</p>

<p>The guards moved away in a hurry, glad of the excuse
to get out of what seemed to them a very dangerous situation.
But Calaman stuck to his place. There was no
cowardice in the old priest.</p>

<p>Chick was as good as his word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Calaman involuntarily lifted his hands in astonishment
as he saw that there was only one fresh hole, but that
it went far into the skull—so nearly through, that some
of the sand with which it was tightly stuffed filtered
out at the back.</p>

<p>The priest turned toward the white men, just as Nick
Carter spoke again, in a loud tone, as a new idea came
to him.</p>

<p>“Stand where you are,” he requested of Calaman. “I’ll
show you that the death stick can be made to strike closely
without hurting anybody when we ask it to do so.”</p>

<p>Calaman stood still, as if he did not quite understand
what was meant. Then Nick fired three shots so quickly
that they sounded like the roll of a drum—one to the
right, one to the left, and another a foot above the head
of the priest. All three bullets just shaved him.</p>

<p>As the detective held up a hand and smiled, to indicate
that it was all over, Calaman stalked toward him. He was
outwardly calm, whatever may have been his thoughts.
The old fellow was a past master in hiding his emotions.</p>

<p>“You held my life in your hands,” he said. “I saw that
each of those little metal cases meant death, and I heard
the whir as they passed by my head. Now, show me how
to use them, and perhaps I will let the white man you
seek go free. Besides, I may give you all many presents.”</p>

<p>“You say ‘perhaps’ you will let our friend, the white
man in your city, go free,” rejoined Nick Carter. “Do you
forget that you promised he should be delivered to us?
Also you said that there was no enmity between us. I
am showing you how we use our death sticks. I would
not do that for one whom I believed to be an enemy.”</p>

<p>Calaman smiled inscrutably, and his dark eyes were almost
hidden in their sockets for an instant. He looked
the incarnation of cunning and malevolence.</p>

<p>“Show it all to me, and your friend shall go free to-night,
in honor of the feast of the Golden Scarab,” he
promised smoothly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Nick Carter. But he was not
blinded in the least by the priest’s sudden acquiescence.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t mean to do it,” whispered Patsy. “He isn’t
on the level, and I know it.”</p>

<p>“Of course he isn’t,” returned Nick. “But don’t talk.
We shall win in the end.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” breathed Patsy Garvan confidently.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<br />
<small>NICK FINDS A NEW FRIEND.</small></h2>


<p>“I should like to try one of the death sticks,” declared
the priest persuasively. “Could you show me how to do
it?”</p>

<p>This was a feeler that the detective knew meant mischief
if the priest were able to follow it up. But there
was no way of blocking the game just then. So Nick
seemed to accept it with perfect good humor.</p>

<p>“This is a white man’s weapon,” he warned Calaman,
as he held up the rifle for inspection. “You may try it.
But sometimes it will hurt those who do not understand
it.”</p>

<p>“I will take the risk,” was Calaman’s dogged response.</p>

<p>“Very well. Then you place a cartridge in the breech in
this way,” explained Nick, as he illustrated with Jai Singh’s
rifle, which he had taken from the tall Hindu’s hand.</p>

<p>While showing the priest how the cartridge was put in,
Nick had slyly driven the muzzle of the weapon into the
sand at his feet, plugging the barrel very badly.</p>

<p>“I see,” observed Calaman. “Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Not quite. You place this end of the stick against
your shoulder, to hold it firm. Then you press your finger
against this bit of steel. When you do that there will be
a loud noise, and the bit of lead, like those you saw in
that dried head, will fly out and strike anything that may
be in the way.”</p>

<p>Calaman listened intently. Then he took the rifle in his
hands with the joy of a child in handling a new toy.</p>

<p>Under Nick Carter’s guidance, he placed the butt against
his shoulder, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The detective had said there would be a loud noise.</p>

<p>There was. The plugged rifle came near bursting, and
the recoil knocked Calaman backward in a most undignified
somersault, with a badly bruised shoulder and half
stunned.</p>

<p>“I told you it was a white man’s weapon,” chuckled the
detective, “and dangerous to those who did not understand
it. You are not hurt?”</p>

<p>The priest did not reply to the question. He was scowling
wickedly, as he got up, with the assistance of two of
his guards, and rubbed his shoulder.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan could not repress his mirth. He let out
a loud snort of enjoyment before Chick could stop it, and
then had to get behind the others to recover himself.</p>

<p>Calaman appeared not to notice all this disturbance. But
there is no doubt that he knew all about it, and privately
resolved to punish Mr. Garvan in his own good time.</p>

<p>“You have shown me things, white man,” he purred, in
his mildest manner as he turned to Nick Carter. “Now
I will show you that which none of your race have seen
before. Follow me!”</p>

<p>In a low tone he gave instructions to the captain of
his guard. At once a number of them formed into column
and marched on ahead, while a few remained behind, as
bodyguard for the priest.</p>

<p>“Come!” requested Calaman.</p>

<p>As the little party of strangers marched through the
streets behind their priestly conductor, Nick Carter noticed
that there was some sort of suppressed excitement
among the teeming populace.</p>

<p>Angry murmurs arose, and now and again stones and
garbage were flung from somewhere.</p>

<p>At first Nick and his companions thought the missiles
were intended for them. Soon, however, they saw that
they were mistaken.</p>

<p>From a house on their right there suddenly dashed a
man, naked to the waist, who was brandishing a short,
heavy-bladed sword, and who seemed to be frantic with
fury.</p>

<p>With a shriek of rage, he flew at the captain of the
guard, and, with one slashing cut, killed the man.</p>

<p>That was not all. He swept right and left with his
formidable sword, and down went two more soldiers.</p>

<p>It was over in a second, and the maniacal slayer seemed
to be looking around for new victims.</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated Jai Singh. “There is a man! Quick
as a panther! And how he can strike! He went clean
through the skull and halfway through the shoulder before
his blade turned.”</p>

<p>Jai Singh had become suddenly filled with the blood fury
that always lay a little below the surface in him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
would have dashed forward with his spear, to fight anybody
or anything, if Nick Carter had not held him back.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he commanded in the Hindu’s ear, in stern tones.
“This is not our business. Keep out! We shall have
enough fighting before we are through. I’ll tell you when
to use your spear.”</p>

<p>Jai Singh panted with eagerness to get into the fray.</p>

<p>“But, sahib,” he returned, in a hoarse murmur, “if I
could stand back to back with that man for a few moments—he
with that sword of his, and I with my spear—there
would be a fight that you would like to see. We two
could eat up the whole guard of the old priest, and do what
we liked in Shangore!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter only waved his hand, and gradually Jai
Singh subsided.</p>

<p>The strength and agility of the man who had run amuck
were amazing. He escaped from the ring of spears that
hedged him in, seemingly by a miracle. His sword flashed
up and down, finding its mark each time. He might have
been invincible.</p>

<p>Numbers told at last, however. As the man’s arm tired,
a spear was thrust into his chest. He sprang back, with
a roar of rage, and flourished his sword valiantly. But
it was no use. Another spear was embedded between his
shoulder blades from behind, and he dropped—dead.</p>

<p>The body was picked up and flung carelessly aside, the
dead and wounded guards were carried into a house near
by, and the procession moved on as if there had been no
interruption.</p>

<p>Calaman had looked on impassively throughout the whole
incident, but Nick Carter could make out indications of
cold, black rage working within him. Also he noted the
scowls of the populace and a certain fidgeting of some
of the soldiers in his vicinity.</p>

<p>One man in particular, whose rather elaborate uniform
proclaimed him to be an officer, showed that he was disgusted
with the tragedy that had just taken place, and
that he blamed others than the wretched victims.</p>

<p>This officer was a fine-looking man, with well-cut, high-bred
features, while his black eyes appeared to look through
anything upon which they might chance to be fixed.</p>

<p>It was evident that he found it hard to restrain himself
while the poor, demented creature was struggling
with the guard. Once or twice he fingered his sword hilt.
At such times his piercing eyes were fixed upon Calaman,
while his black brows met in a menacing frown.</p>

<p>He caught Nick Carter’s eye, and at once there was an
understanding between the two men.</p>

<p>“Why are such things allowed, my friend?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“Because that fiend there, Calaman, and his under-priests,
rule the land,” was the savage reply, in an undertone.
“They have the power and the secret of the Golden
Scarab. The people cry out and complain. But that is all.
They are superstitious, and they have never understood
what the Golden Scarab is, or how it controls their
destinies.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like the worst kind of bunk,” muttered Patsy
to Chick. “I’d put my foot on this Scarab thing, if I lived
here.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” returned Chick. “Let’s hear what this man has
to say.”</p>

<p>“The priests rule everything in Bolongu, and particularly
in this city of Shangore,” went on the officer to Nick
Carter. “Meanwhile we, the nobles, and the rightful rulers
of the land, have to pretend that we are loyal to these
same priests and that we follow their bidding because
we like it.”</p>

<p>“There is a nobility in Bolongu, then?” asked the
detective.</p>

<p>“As old as any in the world,” was the proud reply.
“Look you! That man who rushed out of the house, with
his bare sword, and who has just been prodded to death,
was of royal blood, a cousin of Prince Tillo. Yet, because
he was suspected of plotting against the priesthood,
his wife is condemned to die to-day by the Scarab.”</p>

<p>“Die by the Scarab? What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“You will see,” was the enigmatical answer. “It will be
this afternoon. Be careful, stranger, you walk a dangerous
path! You have strange powers, as I have seen with my
own eyes. Yet Calaman is cunning and will lay a trap
for you. Even now you may be standing within reach
of the claws of the Golden Scarab.”</p>

<p>“What is the Golden Scarab I have heard so much
about?” asked the detective. “Surely a strong man like
yourself, with a sword that no doubt you know how
to wield, could kill it—that is, if there is such a thing
as this Scarab, and it is not some fairy tale for children!”</p>

<p>“Wait till this afternoon. I’ll try and have more talk
with you then. Calaman is watching us now. When the
people are gathered in the amphitheater over there this
afternoon, the white man you seek is to be brought out
to die the death of the Scarab!”</p>

<p>Horror-stricken as Nick Carter was when he heard
this, he was glad the officer had spoken so softly that only
he had heard the words. Particularly he was pleased that
they had not reached the ears of Jefferson Arnold. If they
had, nothing could have prevented the peppery old millionaire
flinging himself at once upon Calaman and his
guards in an endeavor to save his son.</p>

<p>Such an attack could not but have been unsuccessful
just then.</p>

<p>“You say the white man is to die this afternoon?”
murmured Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not until some others who are condemned have
been disposed of.”</p>

<p>“But—this must not be,” exclaimed Nick, in the same
low tone, but with the fire of determination blazing in his
gray eyes. “This young man is the son of one of the most
powerful and wealthiest men in the big country from
which I come—America. You have heard of it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I have,” returned the officer. “Who has
not? But if this young white man is to be saved, it must
be by your own endeavors. There is one thing more,” he
added, after a short pause: “If I can help in any way, I
will. Perhaps I can. But no more words. Calaman is
beckoning.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>HOW CALAMAN KEPT HIS WORD</small></h2>


<p>“Whom does he want? You?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“I think not. He seems to be looking at you. Go!”</p>

<p>“One moment!” begged Nick Carter. “Do you know
Calaman very well? Is he your friend or an enemy?”</p>

<p>“Outwardly we are on good terms,” was the answer.
“But who can trust Calaman? He trusts me, I believe,
because once I did him a service—it matters not what. But
if once he got an inkling of a suspicion, even now, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
last hour, neither you nor I would see the sun sink below
those hills to-night. Now go, before he gets suspicious.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter strode over to the priest, apparently unconcerned,
but with every sense on the alert.</p>

<p>“Stranger! Accompany me!” came from Calaman.
“You shall see to-day something you could never have
anticipated.”</p>

<p>“I believe that,” was Nick Carter’s quiet response.</p>

<p>They had reached the steps of the temple. It was a
magnificent structure, built with the architectural skill of
any American or European pile of its kind. It seemed to
be of the finest marble, and the great dome was covered
with thin sheets of beaten gold that glistened in the sun
as if it were afire.</p>

<p>On the lower steps the guard halted. Calaman, accompanied
by all of Nick Carter’s party—except Captain, Nick
Carter’s splendid bloodhound, who had trotted along
modestly at their heels throughout all their peregrinations,
without trying to force himself into notice, paused.</p>

<p>He gave a sign to the guards, and one of them took
Captain by his massive collar.</p>

<p>If Chick had not spoken a few words to the bloodhound
on the instant, the soldier never could have retained
his grip. But when Chick told the dog to go with him
and be quiet, he obeyed with the docility that was one
of his predominant characteristics.</p>

<p>Once inside the temple, Nick Carter was struck by the
coolness, in contrast with the stifling heat outside.</p>

<p>“Seems like a fine building,” remarked Chick.</p>

<p>“Nothing slow about this!” muttered Patsy. “Reminds
me of the Pennsylvania Station in New York.”</p>

<p>It was a minute or two before their eyes became accustomed
to the gloom.</p>

<p>As they began to distinguish their surroundings, Chick
observed softly that he understood now what was meant
by “dim, religious light.”</p>

<p>The party had just time to note that the interior of the
temple was quite the equal in beauty and impressiveness
to the outside, when the clang of heavy, metal-sheathed
doors sounded behind them, the echoes repeating themselves
indefinitely.</p>

<p>Then things began to happen quickly.</p>

<p>White-robed priests seemed to rise from the floor on
every side of them, and, before they could raise a hand
to defend themselves, each member of the party was
pounced upon by half a dozen men, who bound their arms
behind their back.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the captives submitted
without a battle.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan, uttering defiances thick and fast, lashed
out his feet at the bare legs of the priests, and left many
a mark on their shins that they carried for weeks and
months.</p>

<p>“Just give me one of my hands!” howled Patsy. “That’s
all I want—one! I’ll lick ten of these fellows with the
other, and I’ll bet on it. Just give me one hand!”</p>

<p>There was no response to this, and soon Patsy was as
helpless as a dressed duck.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had been fighting desperately, and for a
moment it looked as if he might even get the better of
his assailants. He butted one of them under the chin and
sent him crashing backward upon the marble floor.</p>

<p>“Come on, Chick! Use your gun!” he shouted.</p>

<p>But there were too many men against the party.</p>

<p>Even as the detective called to his assistant, the loop
of a rope was thrown over his head, and catching him
around the waist, pinned his arms to his sides, and brought
him back with a jerk, panting and furious.</p>

<p>Everybody in the party was a prisoner by this time, and
Nick Carter’s busy brain was working to devise a way of
escape.</p>

<p>That was his way always when in a tight fix. He never
wasted time bewailing his fate, but used all his wits in
seeking relief.</p>

<p>A chuckling laugh that he recognized as coming from
Calaman made him turn his face in that direction.</p>

<p>“Calaman!” he called.</p>

<p>“I am here.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?”</p>

<p>“Part of the ceremony, my dear white stranger,” replied
the high priest’s voice. “That is all.”</p>

<p>There was another stifled chuckle, as if Calaman were
enjoying the situation too much for mere words.</p>

<p>It had been a trap carefully prepared, and Nick Carter
was obliged to admit that it had worked to perfection.</p>

<p>“You will pay for this, Calaman,” he said sternly.</p>

<p>“I am willing to pay for anything I want,” was the calm
reply.</p>

<p>“You promised to show us the city,” continued Nick.
“And to release the white man you have as prisoner. That
was to be the payment for our showing you how the
death sticks work.”</p>

<p>The high priest did not try to repress a sneering laugh
as he stepped in front of Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“I have not said yet that I will not let the white
man go,” Calaman reminded the detective.</p>

<p>“Why have you worked this outrage on us?” demanded
Nick Carter. “Less than half an hour ago I held your
life in my hands, as you know. Yet I did you no harm
with my death stick.”</p>

<p>“I wish you or Chick had put half a dozen bullets into
the old rip,” observed Jefferson Arnold.</p>

<p>Calaman glanced at the millionaire with a scowl that
promised no good to that impetuous gentleman. Then he
turned again to Nick Carter, with a cunning smile, as
he fingered his long gray beard.</p>

<p>“I know I made some such promise,” he purred, smiling.
“And, behold, I am keeping my word to the letter. I
promised you free entrance to the city—and you are here.
I promised to entertain you as my guests, and I sent you
food and wine and the choicest tobacco to smoke.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” muttered Jefferson. “He’s as cunning
as a rat. Oh, wait till I get out of these ropes! If
I don’t choke him till his eyes pop out——”</p>

<p>“You see,” continued the priest steadily, “I’ve done everything
I promised. You asked to see the city, and even
now you stand in its most noble building. As to the other
white prisoner—the one who was caught as he tried to
break through my guards last night—I promised that you
should see and have speech with him. So you shall—this
afternoon, in the arena of the Golden Scarab, before you
all shall die with him.”</p>

<p>He laughed malignantly and glanced at the bonds of
his prisoners, as if to assure himself they were secure.</p>

<p>“You are not ashamed of such vile treachery?” asked
Nick Carter, his eyes flashing in disgust.</p>

<p>“All is fair in diplomacy and war, my stranger friend,”
was the cool answer. “I know enough of the outside
world to be aware that that truth is accepted everywhere.
Besides, I have kept faith with you in every particular.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“This looks like it.”</p>

<p>“This state of things was brought on by yourselves,”
snarled Calaman. “You were unwise enough to boast
to me that in those metal cases of yours you held the
lives of two thousand men. If your words be true—and,
frankly, I believe they are—surely I should be foolish to
give you your liberty, or to leave you even now with such
weapons in your hands.”</p>

<p>“You contemptible old fraud!” burst out Nick. “You
shall pay for this. We are not dead men yet.”</p>

<p>“You will be before sundown.”</p>

<p>The priest snapped this at the detective. Then he signed
to his guards to seize the rifles and the spear that Jai
Singh carried, and which the Hindu never before had allowed
out of his hands, even when he had a rifle as
well.</p>

<p>There was a desperate fight when they tried to take away
the spear.</p>

<p>Jai Singh had a superstitious regard for his favorite
weapon, and bound though he was, he gave the guards
such a tussle that one of them had a great gash in his
arm before he could tear the spear out of its owner’s
grasp.</p>

<p>“Look around you, my stranger guests,” said Calaman,
when the struggle was over. “This is the Temple of the
Golden Scarab, and those you see in their places on the
walls are his victims. He claims a certain number once
every year at the coming of the full moon. Look!”</p>

<p>They saw that the vast circular walls were faced by
serried tiers of niches, in each of which was a mummified,
headless form, wrapped in beaten gold.</p>

<p>Over each mummy was a horrible shrunken head in a
smaller niche.</p>

<p>There were hundreds and hundreds of them, tier upon
tier.</p>

<p>“These are only the noble born of the Scarab’s victims,”
explained Calaman. “The common herd are flung
into the lake, where the alligators get them. That empty
place over there, on the farthest wall, is for the Prince
Tillo, whose body was prepared by one of our medicine
men in a cave in the hills.”</p>

<p>“We saw that,” put in Nick Carter, almost before he
knew he had spoken. “It was an awful sight.”</p>

<p>The priest laughed.</p>

<p>“You are oversensitive, stranger. I was going to say
that Prince Tillo was a great man and powerful—too
powerful, for his removal caused some discontent among
the people. That is partly why I wanted those sticks
of yours. If the discontent should rise to a head, it
would be difficult to deal with them.”</p>

<p>“This does not concern me,” broke in Nick Carter.
“What are you going to do with us now?”</p>

<p>“Those other empty recesses on the wall are for certain
nobles who will die this afternoon, and for you, my
stranger guests. It will be an honor to you, and especially
to the dark men you have with you. But you do
not belong to Bolongu, and the people will be told that
you are all noble in your own countries.”</p>

<p>He turned away. As he did so, several of the guards
led them through a low archway, down a flight of steps,
and into a cell beneath the floor of the temple.</p>

<p>They were bolted in, and left in pitch darkness. Moreover,
the air was hot and oppressive.</p>

<p>The first silence was broken by Patsy.</p>

<p>“Well, chief, what now?” he asked. “Of course, we
have to get out of this somehow.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, Patsy,” admonished Chick. “Be ready to
take orders.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I always am,” retorted Patsy. “I’m only
asking.”</p>

<p>“If we could get our hands free!” muttered Nick Carter,
as he struggled with his bonds. “There would be a
few less priests of the Golden Scarab in the world the next
time any of them came.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” broke out Patsy.</p>

<p>“Can’t we untie each other’s hands?” suggested Jefferson
Arnold.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it can’t be done,” was Nick’s reply. “The
knots are too firm, and they are all behind us. No, all we
can do is to wait. There is one thing not to be forgotten,
and it may be of considerable help to us.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“We all have our pistols and some cartridges in our
pockets. They did not seem to think of them when they
took our rifles.”</p>

<p>“If I had my spear, I should not want anything else,”
lamented Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“So we can have one good fight before the end comes,”
continued Nick. “If I don’t drive a few holes into Calaman,
it will be because all my cartridges miss fire.”</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan chuckled in the darkness. It was seldom
that his chief made such threats. It told Patsy that there
would be action after a while.</p>

<p>It was about half an hour afterward when the door
opened, showing half a dozen men in the vestments of
the priesthood.</p>

<p>Some carried lanterns, while others bore dishes of fruit
and meat and wine in great flagons.</p>

<p>These they set upon the one rough table that was in
the prison. Then two of them loosened a hand each of
the prisoners, so that they could help themselves to food
and drink, while behind each stood a tall priest, with
drawn sword, ready to strike at the first sign of resistance.</p>

<p>The hand of Patsy Garvan stole to his belt, but Nick
Carter shook his head, and his young assistant attacked his
food like the rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.
<br />
<small>THE SCRATCH AT THE DOOR.</small></h2>


<p>“I have my long knife in my sash, where it is hidden,”
whispered Jai Singh to Nick Carter, who was next to him.
“I could stick that fat pig at my side before he knew
what I meant to do. Then you and the others could clean
out the remainder with your pistols.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Jai Singh!” responded Nick guardedly. “They
will hear you.”</p>

<p>“No. They are too far from us to hear me whisper.
Will you let me do it? We can, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“It would be of no use,” replied Nick, from behind the
goblet as he lifted it to his mouth. “Even if we killed off
most of those here, there are hundreds of others within
hearing. We could never get out of the building.”</p>

<p>“It would be a good way to die,” insisted Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“We came here to get Sahib Leslie,” the detective reminded
him.</p>

<p>This had more effect upon the tall Hindu than anything
else that had been said. He was loyal to the two Arnolds.</p>

<p>“I do as you say, sahib,” he returned resignedly. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I wish these priests would go soon. They make the red
mist to swim before my eyes.”</p>

<p>The meal was soon dispatched. Then, the priests having
tied their hands again, went out. The party of prisoners
were again in darkness.</p>

<p>There was silence for some minutes. Each was occupied
with his own thoughts, except Jai Singh, who, with the
philosophy of his race, curled up on the floor and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>“What do you think about my boy, Carter?” asked Jefferson
Arnold suddenly. “Surely there must be some way
to save him?”</p>

<p>“There’s got to be,” answered Nick briefly.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t be likely to kill him before we get out
of this cell, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Not at all probable. They are to have this Festival
of the Golden Scarab this afternoon, and, from what I
gather, it is a very ceremonious affair, at which all the
people of the city will be present. They will have us there
to see the executions.”</p>

<p>“They’ll never execute my boy!” declared Jefferson
Arnold.</p>

<p>“I promise you that,” said Nick Carter earnestly.</p>

<p>“I know I have a strong objection to being stuck on
a shelf in that temple overhead. That seems the worst
part of it,” remarked Chick.</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you there, Chick. If we are dead,
it won’t matter much what monkey tricks they play with
us afterward. Only I don’t intend to let them kill any
of us. So there will be no niches in the temple for us
to be put in. As for Leslie, we came into this city to
rescue him, and we are going to do it.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter said this in the resolute tone usual with
him when he had made up his mind, and it inspired confidence
in all his companions.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan indulged in a chuckle, and Jefferson Arnold
edged up to the detective in the blackness and nudged him
with an elbow. It was the next best thing to shaking
hands.</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Chick suddenly. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“What?” blurted out Patsy.</p>

<p>“Oh, keep quiet,” rebuked Chick. “Listen!”</p>

<p>“Something is moving outside the door,” whispered
Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“I heard it,” added Jefferson Arnold.</p>

<p>“So did I,” declared Adil, who had not spoken much
since he had been in the cell.</p>

<p>They all listened—except Jai Singh, who still snored
contentedly.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a cat,” murmured Patsy.</p>

<p>There was a faint, but regular, scratching outside the
door, but it made too much noise for a cat.</p>

<p>They had visions of some monstrous creature trying to
force his way into the cell, and all except Nick Carter
shuddered with the terror that comes sometimes to the
bravest man in the face of the unknown.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to kick if it comes at us,” said Patsy.
“That’s all we can do. If only we had our hands free!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” growled Chick. “While we are wishing,
why not wish we were outside this city, with Leslie
Arnold, and everything all right? Keep still till we see
what we are going to do.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” ordered Nick Carter.</p>

<p>The scratching continued, and then it came to the detective
that the sound might mean something good for
them, instead of evil.</p>

<p>“You remember that officer who was talking to us?” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Chick, with a note of hope in his voice.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” added the millionaire.</p>

<p>“He may be trying to get to us.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, of course,” exclaimed Patsy, jumping to a
conclusion with his customary haste.</p>

<p>“We don’t know yet,” went on Nick Carter. “But——”</p>

<p>More scratching, and Nick Carter was sure the noise
was made in a regular cadence, as if it were meant
for a signal.</p>

<p>“That officer showed that he was friendly,” he murmured.
“Perhaps he has found out where we are.”</p>

<p>“He’s a big man in the city,” remarked Chick.</p>

<p>“Exactly. And he could go pretty nearly where he likes—in
the temple or anywhere else,” was Nick Carter’s response.
“I’ll try to find out, if only I can do it, with these
confounded ropes around my arms. Keep still, everybody.”</p>

<p>With considerable difficulty, Nick contrived to roll himself
across the floor to the door. Once there, he got the
toe of his shoe against it and scratched three times, with
a distinct pause between each scratch.</p>

<p>At once there came three scratches like his own, on the
outside.</p>

<p>“Bully!” burst out of Patsy.</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>Nick scratched again three times, and now there came
a result of his signaling which was even better than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>There were three quick scratches outside, and then the
sound of a key grating in the lock.</p>

<p>Nick Carter rolled himself away from the door, to see
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>“Look out for treachery, boys!” he whispered.</p>

<p>But there was nothing of that kind this time. In another
moment the door swung gently open, and there appeared
a small red spot of light in the blackness.</p>

<p>As the red spot moved about, a low voice came to them,
the tone of which was unmistakably friendly.</p>

<p>“Do not fear, strangers! Above all, don’t make any
noise. It is I, Lord Slava, come to help you. I talked to
one of you to-day, the man who first showed what could
be done with the death stick, when he put pieces of lead
into the head swinging to the cord.”</p>

<p>“That’s you, chief,” whispered Chick.</p>

<p>“I am the person you spoke to, Lord Slava,” said Nick
Carter to their unseen visitor. “You were friendly.”</p>

<p>“I am friendly,” came the response. “If you will come
with me, you may yet escape the sacrifice. The feast does
not begin for an hour.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I’d like to keep out of it,” observed Patsy.</p>

<p>If Chick’s hands had been free, he certainly would have
given Patsy a nudge that would have taken the breath
out of him.</p>

<p>“You are tied, are you not?” asked Slava.</p>

<p>“You bet!” replied Patsy.</p>

<p>The visitor seemed not to understand this American
idiom, and Nick Carter followed it with plainer language.</p>

<p>“Our hands are tied behind our backs.”</p>

<p>“I thought so.”</p>

<p>Lord Slava blew on the little torch he carried, and which
made the red spot of fire. It lightened up under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
breath, until there was enough illumination for him to
see where the prisoners were.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon have these off,” he remarked.</p>

<p>With deft, quick strokes, he cut their bonds.</p>

<p>Jai Singh had woke up, and, catching the last few remarks
made, he understood that a friend had come to
help them. So he rolled over to have the ropes taken off
his limbs.</p>

<p>When he was free, the tall Hindu arose and stretched
himself with a grunt of satisfaction that was almost as
loud as Patsy Garvan’s.</p>

<p>When they were all released, and had had a few moments
in which to move about, to get their blood again in
circulation, Lord Slava gave the word for them to depart.</p>

<p>“Follow me closely,” he cautioned. “One false step may
arouse the whole of this nest of vermin. But the way I
shall take you is not long, and we can soon be out of
immediate danger.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got my hands to use again danger is just
what I want,” mumbled Patsy to himself. “Gee! There’s
nothing I’d like better than a rough-house right here.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, Patsy,” admonished Nick Carter, whose keen
hearing very little ever escaped.</p>

<p>The prisoners followed Lord Slava step by step, paused
while he opened another door and closed it carefully
after them all, and passed after him down a long, low,
damp-smelling tunnel.</p>

<p>They went on till they came to a sharp turn. There
they felt the fresh air blowing on their faces, and saw
an oval patch of sky in front and above them.</p>

<p>The friendly officer of the guard placed his heel on the
torch and stamped out the fire.</p>

<p>“Now we may speak in safety,” he told them. “But
not loudly, for soon the crowd will begin to assemble.”</p>

<p>“Is the festival going to begin again?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“Very soon.”</p>

<p>“We are not too late to save my son—the white man
who is to be sacrificed?” asked Jefferson Arnold eagerly.</p>

<p>“We are not too late,” replied Lord Slava quietly.</p>

<p>“They intend to kill him?” came from Chick.</p>

<p>“If they are not stopped.”</p>

<p>“They will be stopped,” declared Nick Carter grimly.
“Thanks to Lord Slava, here, I am sure of it now.”</p>

<p>“I believe you can do it,” smiled Lord Slava. “But you
must use great caution. I’ll confess I have helped you at
the risk of my life. Calaman has no mercy on those who
oppose him. I’m with you in this venture. In return, I
ask you to stand by me.”</p>

<p>“Till the death!” returned Nick Carter earnestly.</p>

<p>“Here, too,” added Chick.</p>

<p>“And you can bet your pile on me,” announced Patsy.</p>

<p>“Where do we strike first?” asked Jefferson Arnold.</p>

<p>“I only have my knife,” bewailed Jai Singh. “It will
have to serve until I can get a spear. But I’ll take one
from some of those men as soon as I get near to
them.”</p>

<p>“I have a revolver,” modestly spoke Adil, who seldom
said anything unless he considered it absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” asked Nick Carter. “Make a
sudden rush? That would suit me and all my party.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” indorsed Patsy. “Good stuff!”</p>

<p>“We must proceed cautiously,” answered Lord Slava,
“and yet with boldness. We will make an onslaught
at the proper moment, which may either result in the
death of us all, or rid the land forever of these pestilent
priests.”</p>

<p>“They seem to have the country by the throat,” observed
Nick.</p>

<p>“They have. We nobles, as well as the common people,
all know that. The time has come for a desperate
rebellion.”</p>

<p>“We seem to have come to Shangore at an opportune
moment,” remarked the detective.</p>

<p>“You have. So I promise that if you die, you shall at
least die fighting. If you live, and I also, then you may
take your toll of the treasures of the temple. Those
treasures are enormous, for the Bolongus are a wealthy
people.”</p>

<p>“That listens good!” commented Patsy.</p>

<p>“We are lucky, I should say,” added Chick, delighted
at the prospect of a big fight, with prize money as a
pleasant incidental.</p>

<p>“Speak on, Lord Slava,” requested Nick Carter. “You
have done much for us already. For that we owe you
thanks—not in words, but in deeds. As for the treasure,
we are not thinking of that.”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, chief?” murmured Patsy, and this
time he spoke so low that not even Nick Carter overheard.</p>

<p>“We will help you with this stroke of yours, Lord
Slava,” declared Nick. “If it gives us a chance to get
even with that rascally Calaman, so much the better.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>ARMED FOR THE RUSH.</small></h2>


<p>“It is against Calaman that our stroke will be directed,”
declared Lord Slava sternly. “He and his followers. I
will tell you in brief why we hate him.”</p>

<p>“You need not unless you wish it,” returned Nick
Carter. “We will fight him hard without knowing that.
He has injured us enough to give us cause for battle.”</p>

<p>Lord Slava took no notice of the detective’s words. He
seemed to be thinking of other days, and as if he had
forgotten where he was or to whom he was talking.</p>

<p>“In years gone by,” he went on, “we were a fighting
race, ruled over by princes, and we cut out a path for
ourselves with our swords and spears. This was the
way it was for generations. Then, little by little, the
priests gained power, and we of the Golden Scarab fell
more and more under their domination, until now no man
dares call his life his own.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen that already,” commented Nick.</p>

<p>“The priests have established a custom to make all who
have offended them die the death of the Scarab on the
occasion of the annual festival. There is no escape.
They pick out the most powerful of the nobles—those
who have the ear of the people—as well as the common
malefactors. Last year Prince Tillo, my uncle, was one
of the victims. The only reason I myself have escaped
is that I am one of Calaman’s officers.”</p>

<p>“That’s lucky for you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps!” replied Slava, with a shrug. “But now
word has gone around that there is to be a great killing.
In addition to you strangers and the other white prisoner
you have come here to carry away, they have seized my
brother and seven others of the chief nobles of the land.
They had to capture these last in secret, for Calaman and
his creatures fear the nobles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, but what are we to do about it?” interrupted
Nick Carter, rather impatiently. “This killing will not be
allowed to go on, will it?”</p>

<p>“Not if it can be prevented.”</p>

<p>“Well, it can,” interposed Chick, who had been listening
indignantly to Lord Slava’s narration.</p>

<p>“I have gathered together certain of my followers,” explained
Slava, “and we are sworn to rescue our friends
or die.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” snorted Patsy Garvan. “What else? That’s
the only sporting thing to do.”</p>

<p>“We are some three hundred, all told,” went on Slava.
“The priests outnumber us six to one. But the people, I
believe, are on our side, if we can stop the first rush.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to stop it,” was Nick Carter’s remark.</p>

<p>“I believe we can, with your help, stranger. With your
strange weapons—your death sticks—we might turn the
tide in our favor. We might even slay the Golden Scarab
itself. In that case, the whole nation would thank
you.”</p>

<p>“This Golden Scarab is alive, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Big?”</p>

<p>“Very.”</p>

<p>“Where did it come from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Nobody does—except Calaman and those
who are very near to him. The creature is seen only
once a year at the festival. Where it goes for the rest
of the time I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p>“Queer!” mused Carter. “It doesn’t sound natural,
somehow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t,” returned Lord Slava. “However, you
will see it this afternoon, and judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Has anybody ever tried to kill it, or find out what it
really is?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Often. But always without success. It is useless for
us to talk about it. You will admit that when you see
the thing,” added Lord Slava, shaking his head. “I can
count on you and your friends, can I?”</p>

<p>“You most certainly can,” answered Nick Carter. “I
shall be glad to see this Scarab. And I don’t think it is
going to set us all at defiance successfully. I have a
feeling that we shall get the better of it to-day.”</p>

<p>“Its bite is certain death,” Lord Slava warned him
solemnly.</p>

<p>“So is the bite of my rifle,” returned Nick dryly. “If
I can get hold of it before I meet this insect, I shall not
be afraid of its biting me. If I don’t have the rifle, then
I will try what can be done with an automatic revolver
and a thirty-eight cartridge or two.”</p>

<p>“Or a club,” put in Chick.</p>

<p>“I’ve hunted tigers when they’ve been pretty savage,
and I’ve been in close quarters with them,” put in Jefferson
Arnold. “They never got away with me yet, and
I guess I won’t back down before a thing like this Scarab,
especially with Nick Carter and the others to back me
up.”</p>

<p>“Those priests grabbed all our guns and things,” grumbled
Patsy. “But if I can get hold of one of their spears,
blowed if I don’t try what I can do with it when I run
out of cartridges for my revolver.”</p>

<p>Chick smiled at his comrade’s persistence. He knew
very well that Patsy would do what he said, if there were
nothing better.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to make shift with Bolongu weapons,”
said Lord Slava, with a smile. “Look!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a corner of the tunnel in which they
stood. There were all their rifles, the opened case of cartridges
which had been used when Nick Carter and Chick
fired at the mummified head in the public square, and Jai
Singh’s spear.</p>

<p>The tall Hindu was the first person to make a swoop
upon the collection. He had his beloved spear in his
hand almost as soon as Lord Slava had turned his finger
in that direction, and was flourishing it as joyously as a
boy might play with his toy sword.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Good!” ejaculated Jai Singh.</p>

<p>He rubbed his face all over the shining metal head,
and passed his fingers affectionately along the long shaft.</p>

<p>He could hardly realize that he had again the weapon
that had been such a friend in many a hard-fought
scrimmage, as well as often in the jungle, when he had
stood off wild beasts that only an exceptionally brave
man would dare to face.</p>

<p>Nick Carter slipped cartridges into his rifle until the
magazine was full—taking them out of the opened case,
rather than from his pocket.</p>

<p>His example was followed by all the others. When the
party got on the move again, each member of it had the
means of killing a dozen or so of the enemy right in his
hands.</p>

<p>“How did these things get here?” asked Nick, when he
saw that all his companions were properly equipped.</p>

<p>“I did it,” smiled Lord Slava. “Certain of my men had
charge of them, so I had them conveyed to this place.
Though, I will confess, they seem to me very dangerous
to handle. When I had the death sticks where I could
put my hands on them, I made my way to the cell where
they had put you. I hoped to have your help in the enterprise
I have in view.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you thought of us,” interrupted Nick Carter
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I came secretly, by this tunnel. It has not been
used for very many years. You see, it leads directly from
the temple to the great arena itself. It is in that arena
that the killings will take place.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder they didn’t have the tunnel locked up—if
there is any way of doing it,” suggested Nick.</p>

<p>“There is, but I got the key of the outer door by drugging
one of the priests with wine. After that, there was
no difficulty save in finding out which one of the cells
they had put you in.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t believe we were to stay there without somebody
coming to help us,” said the detective. “It would be
too much bad luck in a small package.”</p>

<p>“See!” broke in Slava. “The people are gathering in
the arena. The festival will soon begin.”</p>

<p>“Queer name to give a wholesale butchery,” remarked
Chick. “A festival.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a revival of the big festivals of the ancient
Romans, after all, Chick,” his chief reminded him.</p>

<p>“That may be. But this is the twentieth century, not
the first—or whenever it was they used to kill people in
the Colosseum,” was Chick’s rejoinder. “Baseball is more
in my line.”</p>

<p>Lord Slava pointed out of the doorway, and the others
all stared out, with strange feelings of mingled interest
and indignation, as they thought of the attempt that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to be made on the lives of Leslie Arnold and themselves.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight, regarded purely in the light
of a spectacle.</p>

<p>They found themselves looking into an immense circular
amphitheater of soft sand. It measured some five
hundred feet across, and was surrounded on all sides by
tier upon tier of stone seats, as symmetrically made as if
each had been the work of a finished artist.</p>

<p>Many of these seats already had occupants, although it
would be some time before the exhibition would begin.
Dimly seen, ghostly forms they were, as they came up
from below and slid silently into their chosen places.</p>

<p>There was a high wall at the bottom of the tiers of
seats, so that those who would take part in the performances
in the arena would not be able to reach the
spectators. In a general way, the place looked like a bullfighting
theater.</p>

<p>The lower seats, next to the top of the wall, were
handsomely decorated. They were reserved for the nobles
and other people of importance. The upper ones, and by
far the greater number, were given over to the populace.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the special seats for the nobility was
a stone archway, with a gilded, barred gate.</p>

<p>“It is by that gate that the Scarab comes for his victims,”
explained Slava. “From that other gate, yonder,
the victims are driven out, or dragged away, as the case
may be.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>THREE IN A ROW.</small></h2>


<p>“Who are to be killed first?” asked Nick Carter, when
they had been looking into the amphitheater for some
minutes.</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Lord Slava, “the first three are malefactors
who deserve no better fate. But after that comes
the challenge.”</p>

<p>“What challenge?” burst out the inquisitive Patsy.</p>

<p>“According to custom, there must be a challenge before
any person of high degree may be put to death. The next
victim on the list is the wife of that man who ran amuck
in the street and whom you saw slain this morning.”</p>

<p>“A woman?” exclaimed Chick, in horror.</p>

<p>“Yes. But we are determined to save her if we can.
So, after the challenge, in the pause before she is brought
in, I will give you the signal,” said Lord Slava, addressing
Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“But what is the challenge?” asked the detective, still
mystified.</p>

<p>“According to the law of Bolongu, any man not condemned
may step into the arena, armed with his own
weapons, and demand to fight the Scarab.”</p>

<p>“And is there always some one to offer this challenge?”
broke in Chick.</p>

<p>“There has been none in the last generation,” replied
Lord Slava. “Even before that the Scarab has never been
vanquished. Were some one to step out and beat it, then
these executions would have to stop.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if it would be a swell thing to put
a bug in the ear of this other bug—or whatever the Scarab
is,” observed Patsy. “It is some kind of a bug, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“A beetle,” answered Slava.</p>

<p>Jai Singh had been busy with his usual occupation when
there was nothing else to be done—namely, polishing his
spear. He looked up now, with an eager light in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I should like to have a look at that beetle,” he remarked.
“It sounds like a good fight. I should have my
spear and this Golden Scarab could come at me with all
his claws. That would be a little in his favor. Still, I
believe I should be the victor.”</p>

<p>Lord Slava smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“You are a brave man, stranger. But you know not
what you ask. The Scarab is no ordinary foe. The very
touch of one of its claws is instant and awful death.”</p>

<p>“My spear is swift, and so am I,” returned Jai Singh
simply.</p>

<p>He went on with his polishing, as if there was nothing
more to be argued, but he listened to all that might be
said.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing slow about Jai Singh,” volunteered
Patsy.</p>

<p>“His spear is as powerful and quick as a shot, it has
always seemed to me,” added Chick.</p>

<p>“At the same time,” went on Patsy, “if you can’t let
Jai Singh take it up, what’s the matter with little boy
Patsy having some fun with this big lightning bug? I’d
make his overcoat rattle, even if I couldn’t plug a few
holes in it.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t do,” was the veto Nick Carter put on this.
“I can’t afford to lose you yet, Patsy.”</p>

<p>Lord Slava evidently admired Patsy Garvan’s pluck, but
he agreed with Nick Carter that the young assistant would
not be the man to offer the challenge on which so much
would depend.</p>

<p>“You will await the signal,” he directed, turning to Nick.
“Do not show yourselves before. As you see, the amphitheater
is fast filling up. It is not safe for me to
stay here any longer. Your escape must have been discovered
by this time.”</p>

<p>“Is any one likely to come here after us?” asked Nick.
“If there should be an attack on us here, why——”</p>

<p>He held up his rifle significantly. Lord Slava shook
his head again.</p>

<p>“There is no danger,” he replied. “Here you are secure.
No man can reach you in this tunnel. I will see to that.
But when you hear the trumpets that will open the
festival, then keep well back, where the shadows are
deep, and do not speak overloud.”</p>

<p>“Who is there to hear us if we do speak?” asked Nick,
somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>“There are seats right over your head. Calaman’s
throne is immediately above where you are standing. The
walls are thick, but it might chance that he would hear
you if you raised your voice even for a word or
two.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Lord Slava gripped the hands of each of
the white men, smiled, and vanished by the way they
had come.</p>

<p>“Not a bad fellow—for a lord,” observed Chick. “But
I didn’t expect to find such things in an out-of-the-way
corner of India like this. You can’t lose ’em. They
will wear titles, no matter where you go.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who gave him his title, anyhow?” mused
Patsy. “There doesn’t seem to be anybody in this country
higher than old Calaman, and I don’t think much of him.
Gee! Jai Singh!” he went on, addressing the Hindu.
“Why don’t you give yourself a rest from polishing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
old spear of yours? It’s got me all dazzled as it is!
It shines like an icicle under an electric light.”</p>

<p>“It may lose its shine when I use it up there,” answered
Jai Singh, with a grim smile, as he nodded toward
the opening of the amphitheater. “I polish only when it
is not used, Sahib Patsy.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, too,” murmured Patsy to himself. “When
there’s real action, you don’t see him primping either his
spear or himself.”</p>

<p>The festival in the arena began, and the thousands of
spectators who had gathered settled down to enjoy the
exhibition.</p>

<p>The first victim was a slouching, hangdog-looking man,
who, if his appearance was a criterion of his character,
ought never to have been out of jail. He was one of the
malefactors who, according to Lord Slava, were to be the
first victims of the Golden Scarab.</p>

<p>He was shoved out of one of the gateways, and as he
stood, shivering, on the sandy floor of the great arena,
with not a look or word of mercy for him anywhere, he
whimpered like a beaten hound.</p>

<p>Then he limped farther into the arena, and gazed about,
as if to see where the enemy that he knew must be at
hand was coming from.</p>

<p>There was a roar from the multitude as the opposite
gates were flung open with a clang.</p>

<p>The man in the middle of the arena seemed to wilt, as
he hugged himself and stared around for a way of escape.</p>

<p>There was no hope for him.</p>

<p>From the gateway a great, nondescript creature, like a
beetle enlarged hundreds of times, and enveloped in a
glistening armor of red and black, worked its way out.
It moved over to its intended victim with a sideways
motion, varied by little darts straight forward.</p>

<p>The man tried to run away, but he was petrified with
fear and could only move a few steps.</p>

<p>A howl of excitement arose from one side of the
massed spectators, spreading rapidly around the whole of
the great amphitheater.</p>

<p>There was no pity in the sound—only interest and that
cruel rapture which is heard at a bullfight when the matador
is no match for his furious enemy charging upon
him.</p>

<p>The first time the Scarab came near the man, he managed
to jump to one side and avoid it. But the respite
was only for the slightest fraction of a second. With a
hurried scuffle, the thing swung around, and its two great
horns, looking like the claws of a gigantic lobster, closed
on him!</p>

<p>The man dropped into the sand, without even a groan.</p>

<p>Almost before the people in the seats realized what
had happened, or had obtained a clear view, the monster
had scuttled back to its den, and attendants were dragging
the dead body of the man out another way by long
chains.</p>

<p>The second victim, who looked a great deal like the
first, was disposed of by the Scarab in about the same
way as the other, except that it was done in rather less
time.</p>

<p>The awful creature had gone back to its retreat, while
the body of its victim was taken out, before the spectators
had time to take in all the details of the encounter.</p>

<p>The third man proved to be of tougher metal than his
two predecessors. Obviously he was a natural-born fighter.</p>

<p>When he was pushed into the arena by the attendants,
his shoulders humped and a look of savage determination
in his pale eyes, there was a general feeling that he would
be more interesting than the other two men who had been
disposed of so quickly.</p>

<p>This fellow kept his gaze on the ground for the most
part. Soon it was seen why he did this. He was looking
for missiles to use against his uncanny foe.</p>

<p>He picked up a pebble here, a lump of rock there, and
an odd piece of metal somewhere else.</p>

<p>He huddled them up in his left arm against his body,
keeping his right hand free to hurl them when the time
should come.</p>

<p>It soon did come. The Golden Scarab came out of its
gateway faster than before, making straight for the desperate
being it was expected to destroy.</p>

<p>The man sent two big stones, but the Scarab seemed
to be incased in such a hard shell that stones would not
hurt it. Instead, it rushed forward with greater fury
than ever.</p>

<p>It was a curious battle, and to Nick Carter it seemed
as if it did not belong to this age at all. The man, in
his strange garments—what there were of them—the
Golden Scarab, looking like nothing that the detective
ever had seen before, and yet so full of life and activity,
and then the massed people, yelling in delight at the imminent
fate of a fellow being!</p>

<p>Used as Nick was to all kinds of sights that only few
men are privileged to see, this one gave him a sinking
feel inside that he could not have described, but which
indubitably was there.</p>

<p>The Scarab moved with incredible swiftness, and the
man was obliged to leap about with the agility of a pantomimic
dancer to keep out of its reach.</p>

<p>The insect—or reptile, whichever it might be called—measured
a good six feet in length, and was about half as
broad. The shell back resembled that of a turtle. But
this creature was much more supple. Besides, the plates
that composed its shell slipped about with an ease and
smoothness never seen in the commoner animal.</p>

<p>It had six legs, with two horns, the length of a tall
man’s arm. These were furnished at the ends with
hooked claws and incisors of a most vicious aspect.</p>

<p>As it darted here and there, its whole body rippled
sinuously, while its scaly back glistened and flashed in
the rays of the bright morning sun.</p>

<p>Its method of attack was peculiarly its own. Every
time it approached its adversary it would raise its horns
and the fore part of its body, strike with the speed of
a cat, and retreat before it could suffer a reprisal.</p>

<p>Not that it seemed to fear anything the man could do.
Several of his stones had struck it, but without any noticeable
effect. The stones made no impression on its hard
shell.</p>

<p>Four times the man dodged around the great ring,
his uncanny foe close behind him. Although he was
making a better showing against the Scarab than most
persons ever had, it was evidently only a question of how
long he could hold out.</p>

<p>At last he tripped over a sharp rock that he had hurled
at his enemy only just before. Down he went, and the
blood flowed from a gash in his foot where he had struck
the edge of the stone.</p>

<p>In a flash the Golden Scarab was upon him. Before
he could scramble to his feet, the two great horns were
flung wide and came together with a clash. The incisors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
drove deeply into his chest. He dropped to the ground,
senseless, a stone still clenched between his stiffening
fingers.</p>

<p>A great gasp went up from the thousands of spectators,
and the hideous Scarab scuttled back to its lair.</p>

<p>Out came several attendants, to drag the remains of the
man away, as they had the others, and the people waited
for the next item of the ghastly program.</p>

<p>Chick and Patsy were gazing steadily at the proceedings
from their sheltered place, and for once the latter
had nothing to say. Only Chick, looking pale under the
coat of tan he had acquired in the fierce heat of tropical
suns, turned to Nick Carter with a husky whisper:</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, chief?”</p>

<p>The detective shook his head frowningly. He was confessedly
puzzled, as well as horrified.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, Chick,” he whispered back. “I’ve
seen many strange sights in the course of my life, but
this beats them all. I don’t think it is mechanism. But
it is an ingenious trick of some kind.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to know what it means?” confessed
Chick.</p>

<p>“So would I,” put in Jefferson Arnold, who had been
listening to the low-voiced colloquy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET.</small></h2>


<p>A loud fanfare on a trumpet echoed across the amphitheater,
and into the narrow corridor whence Nick Carter
and his companions were looking into the arena.</p>

<p>“Fish!” ejaculated Patsy Garvan, with a pitiful attempt
at facetiousness.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, Patsy,” reproved Chick. “This is no time
to be funny.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” whispered Nick Carter sternly.</p>

<p>There was another trumpet blast, and then the voice of
Calaman was heard, somewhere above them, proclaiming,
in a loud voice, the usual challenge of the Golden Scarab.</p>

<p>“Does any man dare challenge the Golden Scarab of
Shangore to mortal combat? A touch of its horns means
death. Is there any one bold enough to join issue with
this antagonist? If so, he is welcome, and may the fates
give victory to the better fighter!”</p>

<p>This was the regulation phrasing of the challenge, as
it was sent forth at each succeeding Festival of the Golden
Scarab. Calaman rattled it off as mechanically as an auctioneer
runs through the merits of a “lot” for which he
knows in advance there will be no bids.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then the voice of Calaman once
more rang through the amphitheater.</p>

<p>“The lists are open to all comers,” he added.</p>

<p>Not a sound was heard, and then there was a surprise!
Jai Singh, with a bound, reached the opening of the tunnel
and sprang into the arena, in front of the throne of
Calaman.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded the priest.</p>

<p>“I am Jai Singh, of the land below the hills,” was the
haughty reply. “I am of high caste, and I am prepared
to do battle with the Golden Scarab. I care not that
the touch of his horns is death. I have death in my spear,
and I will send it to the heart of this creature just as
sure as we meet in combat.”</p>

<p>Calaman, who had turned pale at seeing this man whom
he had thought a prisoner appear suddenly in the amphitheater,
armed with his spear, and hurling his defiance back
in his teeth, frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>“The challenge is not for you,” he blurted out, at
last.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“Only men of my own race, or those who are white,
can be permitted to face the Golden Scarab in honorable
combat.”</p>

<p>“Listen to the old bluff!” whispered Patsy Garvan to
Nick Carter. “‘Honorable combat,’ he says. Gee!”</p>

<p>“The challenge was to all comers,” insisted Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“It did not mean such as you,” was Calaman’s contemptuous
retort.</p>

<p>Jai Singh stood in front of the priest, his spear ready
for action, but with an expression of chagrin on his dark
face that he could not hide.</p>

<p>He made a last appeal:</p>

<p>“Listen, Calaman: You have seen that you could not
keep me in your dungeon, and that should show you
I am worthy to fight your Scarab. If I can set you at
defiance in your own temple, why should I not be allowed
to go further and prove that the things you send out to
battle for you are also of no account?”</p>

<p>Jai Singh had purposely made his tone, as well as his
words, as insulting as he could. He wanted to stir the
priest to unreasoning wrath, believing that that might
lead, sooner than anything else, to his being accepted as
a foe for the Golden Scarab.</p>

<p>But Calaman was too crafty to be carried into indiscretion
by his own anger.</p>

<p>He controlled himself with a strong effort, and waved
Jai Singh away, at the same time nodding to some of his
attendants.</p>

<p>The priest was really afraid that this tall, supple Hindu,
with his spear, might prove victor in a contest with the
Golden Scarab, and he dared not take the chance.</p>

<p>Half a dozen soldiers jumped into the arena and cautiously
approached Jai Singh.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” he warned them, flourishing his spear.
“I am here, standing on my rights, and I will not move.”
Then, to Calaman: “You have promised that if any champion
beats the Scarab, he can claim any reward he wants.
Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“It is the rule,” answered Calaman coldly. “But it does
not concern you.” Then, to his soldiers: “Seize him,
guards! I’ll see whether strangers of his race can come
and beard me on this day of all others—the most sacred
one known to Shangore.”</p>

<p>This bombastical speech did not impress Jai Singh. He
raised his spear with the firm intention of running through
the body the first soldier to come within reach, when a
well-known voice in his ear thundered:</p>

<p>“Stop, Jai Singh!”</p>

<p>He swung around, to see that Nick Carter had rushed
into the arena and was facing Calaman with a half smile
on his strong features.</p>

<p>“Your spear, Jai Singh!” ordered the detective, extending
his hand.</p>

<p>Wonderingly, the Hindu placed the weapon in Nick
Carter’s fingers, and looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Go back to the others,” Nick told him, in a low voice
that no one else overheard. “Be ready for any attack that
may come. Understand?”</p>

<p>Jai Singh made a low salaam, and, without looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
again in the direction of Calaman, strode across the sand
and into the tunnel from which he had emerged.</p>

<p>Calaman had not been able to repress a start when
Nick Carter suddenly came into view and looked at him
defiantly.</p>

<p>The priest had been so much occupied with Jai Singh
that he had not seen whence the detective came. The
first intimation he had of Nick’s presence was when the
intrepid American stood before him, taking Jai Singh’s
spear from his hand.</p>

<p>It was inexplicable to Calaman that Carter should be
free and in the amphitheater so soon after he was known
to be a bound captive in one of the dark dungeons of the
temple.</p>

<p>The escape had been discovered some time before, and
two priests had been trying in vain to trace the fugitives.
Now here was this white man, quite at his ease, and without
any bonds on him, prepared to demand speech with the
most powerful man in Shangore, the great priest, Calaman!</p>

<p>“I have heard the challenge,” called out Nick Carter,
in a clear voice, when the hubbub that had arisen on his
advent had died down. “I, Nicholas Carter, American, a
white man, accept the challenge, and will show this Golden
Scarab that he can no longer claim to be the invincible
fighter of Shangore! Bring forth your Golden Scarab,
Calaman, and let me prove my words on him before you
and all the people of this great city.”</p>

<p>Calaman swallowed his anger with a tremendous effort,
and replied, as if he were not at all taken aback by the
appearance of his late prisoner:</p>

<p>“There is nothing to prevent your fighting, if you like.
But your chance is so small that I count you already
a dead man. What fight you with? The death stick that
you have already shown me?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the prompt reply. “My death stick might
prevail. Probably it would. But I shall meet my foe
with this spear, that belongs to my comrade, Jai Singh.
Since you would not let him take up the challenge, I appear
in his stead, and with his weapon.”</p>

<p>Calaman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It matters little what you fight with,” he sneered. “The
end will be your defeat.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” was Nick Carter’s reply.
“But I want it understood here in public that I am to
have the reward if I vanquish my enemy in this fight.”</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” answered Calaman.</p>

<p>“Then I want to go free, with all my friends, including
the white man, Leslie Arnold, whom you have kept a
prisoner since yesterday,” went on Nick, in a ringing voice.
“Do you grant that?”</p>

<p>“I grant all that if you defeat the Golden Scarab,” answered
Calaman.</p>

<p>“Everybody has heard your promise,” was Nick’s rejoinder.
“Now, bring out this monster of yours, and I
will see how much my chance of victory is worth.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter threw up his spear in salute and strode to
the middle of the arena.</p>

<p>A faint cheer arose from the packed seats of the
common people. It was not very loud, because there was
general awe of Calaman and his associates, but it had
burst forth involuntarily.</p>

<p>Here was a man, for the first time in some fifty years,
brave enough to accept the challenge of the Golden
Scarab.</p>

<p>He was entitled to a cheer, and he got it. But there
were few in that vast assemblage who expected to see
the valiant American leave the place alive.</p>

<p>The gates clanged, and, amid a deathly silence—as if all
those thousands of people were holding their breath in
unison—the gigantic beetle came darting out, bristling for
the fray.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was an adept in the use of the spear, as
he was with all other weapons.</p>

<p>Naturally quick to pick up anything demanding great
dexterity, he had soon learned to swing and stab with
a spear as skillfully as Jai Singh himself.</p>

<p>He had taken his first lessons years before. But he
had done better than that. Since he had been in India
this time, he had placed himself under the tutelage of Jai
Singh, and had learned all the newer tricks that had been
acquired by the great Indian spearman himself.</p>

<p>The detective stood his ground as his hideous foe
approached. His spear was ready to leap forward, seeking
a vital part at any instant.</p>

<p>The Scarab stopped. It seemed as if it realized that
here was an adversary not to be subdued in the ordinary
way, and who, therefore, must be treated with respect.</p>

<p>Chick, Patsy, Jefferson Arnold, Adil, and Jai Singh
were all watching eagerly from their hidden place of vantage,
but none of them spoke. The situation was too tense
for conversation.</p>

<p>For nearly half a minute the Golden Scarab and Nick
Carter stood still, facing each other. Not a sound could
be heard from all the multitude that crowded the seats,
tier above tier, around the immense arena.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>THE FATAL THRUST.</small></h2>


<p>“Why didn’t he take his rifle?” whispered Patsy to
Chick.</p>

<p>“Because a bullet would be of no use against that heavy
shell,” replied Chick. “The only way to kill that animal
would be to aim under it, and that could hardly be done
while it is jumping around. You may be sure the chief
believes a spear is the most handy tool for what he has
to do, or he would not have taken Jai Singh’s from
him.”</p>

<p>“My spear will do it, if anything can,” came in a gruff
undertone from Jai Singh.</p>

<p>Chick had hit on the exact truth. Nick Carter had
studied the strength of the glittering shell of the monster
during the three previous contests—especially the
third one, which was more nearly a fight than either of
the others.</p>

<p>He had seen that heavy stones, thrown with great force,
had not disturbed the Scarab in the least, even when
they struck it fairly and squarely.</p>

<p>The only chance of victory seemed to him to pick out
some vulnerable spot under the thick scales, and to do
that a weapon which could be handled at short range was
essential.</p>

<p>The spear was that weapon. A rifle bullet would
not do.</p>

<p>Nick Carter and his awe-inspiring foe were some thirty
paces apart, each looking for a chance to rush in.</p>

<p>Suddenly the beetle charged upon its antagonist, its
formidable horns raised to deal the death stroke. But
Nick Carter had gauged the pace to an inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>As the great horns, with their poisonous points, opened,
to slash him to death, he gave vent to a derisive laugh,
leaped clear over the glittering, scaly back of the creature,
and coming down firmly on his feet, turned swiftly to
strike with his spear.</p>

<p>The Golden Scarab was too quick for him, however. It
twisted like lightning, and before he could thrust, was
at him again.</p>

<p>This time the claws missed him very narrowly. But
Nick escaped by a hand’s breadth, and dodging to one side,
sent in two fierce stabs!</p>

<p>The strokes were ineffective. They came against the
scales, and the spear quivered from end to end.</p>

<p>The shock of the blows appeared to have hurt the Scarab
a little, however, for it seemed now as if it were trying
to escape. One of its hind legs dragged a little, and it
was not so active as it had been at first.</p>

<p>“Gee! I believe the chief has got its number!” exclaimed
Patsy breathlessly.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was quick to perceive his advantage. Changing
his tactics, the pursuer became the pursued.</p>

<p>Around the arena raced the Golden Scarab, with Nick
Carter close at its heels, seeking to deliver a blow that
would end the battle.</p>

<p>Three times they made the complete circuit of the place,
and each time they passed the gateway through which
the Scarab had come, it tried to run in.</p>

<p>But Nick was always there with his spear, and prevented
the retreat with very little trouble.</p>

<p>The detective found that he could move twice as quickly
as the beetle. But he kept in mind the warning of Lord
Slava, that one touch of the creature’s horns meant death,
and was careful never to let them come too close.</p>

<p>The face of Calaman was livid with fury and fear, but
the crowds in the seats bellowed encouragement in a
great wave of noise that made any words spoken in the
amphitheater a mere waste of breath.</p>

<p>It was now that the companions of Nick Carter, unnoticed
in the general excitement, stepped out from their
hiding place, each—except Jai Singh—with a rifle in his
hand.</p>

<p>There was no question that the Golden Scarab felt itself
beaten, and sought only to escape the weapon of the
agile, watchful man, who seemed to be on all sides at
once.</p>

<p>The monster, finding it could not run away, suddenly
wheeled on Nick and tried to lunge at him with its
poisoned horns. But again the detective easily evaded
the attack, and, with a laugh, leaped to safety. At the
same time he brought his spear down with a crash on
the scaly back.</p>

<p>It was evident to Nick Carter now that he had tired
out his foe. At the same time, he began to feel a little
fatigued himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to bring this performance to an end,” he
muttered. “I believe I’ve got this thing licked. But Calaman
may try some dirty trick on me if I don’t watch. So
I guess I’ll——”</p>

<p>Dodging this way and that, he sought an opening under
the scales for a thrust with his spear that would settle
the argument, once for all.</p>

<p>He did not jab downward, because he had satisfied himself
that he could not hope to pierce the scales. Instead,
he was delivering half-arm thrusts under the armor. All
of them were too short, because he was obliged to keep
clear of the deadly horns.</p>

<p>But his chance came at last. The Golden Scarab
swerved to one side and seemed to reel slightly. Instantly
Nick Carter drove in his spear with all his force, and the
whole length of the barbed iron sank out of sight in
its body.</p>

<p>The rear end crumpled up, and a hoarse scream came
from it at the same instant.</p>

<p>Nick Carter believed he had given it a death wound.
But he did not relax his caution on that account.</p>

<p>It was well that he did not, for the fore part of the
creature swung around and struck at Nick so viciously
that he had only just time to jump clear of the blow.</p>

<p>“Look out, chief!” roared Chick. “He’ll get you yet
if you don’t look out! Mind those horns! Give him
another stab! Get him somehow.”</p>

<p>“Wow! Let me get into that!” shouted Patsy, running
forward, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>“Come back, Patsy!” was Chick’s sharp command. “You
can’t help. You’ll only be in the way.”</p>

<p>But Patsy had seen something that escaped his fellow
assistant, and he kept right on.</p>

<p>“Here’s the gun, chief!” he shouted, as he held out
his rifle.</p>

<p>“Give it to me!” responded Nick Carter. “That was
right, Patsy! Now get back!”</p>

<p>Patsy obeyed, and Nick felt the rifle with the fingers
of an expert, to make sure that there was a cartridge ready
to be discharged.</p>

<p>As Nick took the rifle, the Scarab made a violent
swoop at him with its right tentacle. If the detective
hadn’t leaped aside, the poisoned point would have gone
through his thin linen trouser leg and wounded him to
death.</p>

<p>“Not this time, my friend!” observed the American.</p>

<p>He had jumped well back, out of reach of his foe.
Dropping to one knee, he leveled the rifle and steadied
himself until the fore sight came in line with the writhing,
glittering head, and was clear of the people in the seats
beyond.</p>

<p>Without hurry or excitement, he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>In the hush that had fallen over the immense amphitheater,
everybody heard the bullet strike.</p>

<p>It had reached a vital spot, for the Golden Scarab rolled
over sideways and collapsed.</p>

<p>It was not quite dead, however, for its middle part was
moving feebly.</p>

<p>“Wonder if I’d better give it another shot,” muttered
Nick Carter, as he watched. “Guess not! It’s still now.
Looks as if I’ve settled the thing, by George!”</p>

<p>The awed silence which had fallen upon the great concourse
was broken by a frenzied scream from Calaman.
He was giving a frantic order to somebody to seize the
white man who had profaned the great temple of Shangore
and killed the Golden Scarab!</p>

<p>But no one took any notice of the powerful priest now.
The people were on their feet, most of them cheering the
white man who had laid low the beast which had terrorized
every one for so many years.</p>

<p>A number of Calaman’s guards, unable to shake off the
awe they had so long felt for Calaman, and perhaps
not desiring to do so, rushed toward Nick Carter.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Chick, Patsy, Jefferson Arnold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Jai Singh, and Adil ran into the ring from the other side
and took their stand by their calm-faced leader.</p>

<p>Calaman’s soldiers stopped. They did not know what
to do. There was a look in Nick Carter’s gray eyes that
told them they would have their hands full if they came
too near.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Carter!” cried Jefferson Arnold. “By
the great horn spoon! I didn’t know whether you could
do it or not.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know myself,” admitted Nick. “To tell the
truth, it looked like a very ticklish thing all through.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” suddenly bellowed Chick. “Look who’s here!”</p>

<p>Across the sand came bounding a great dog. He pushed
aside two or three of the soldiers, and the next minute
had his paws on Nick Carter’s shoulders and was licking
his face.</p>

<p>It was Captain!</p>

<p>“All right, old man!” exclaimed Nick. “I know you
mean well, but keep away from my cheek, will you?
Down, Captain!”</p>

<p>The great bloodhound dropped to the sand at once,
while the detective patted his head with an affection that
Captain understood even better than words.</p>

<p>“Look, chief!” cried Patsy Garvan. “They are setting
all the prisoners free!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>WHAT THE GOLDEN SCARAB WAS.</small></h2>


<p>It was just as Nick Carter’s friends rushed to his side,
to help him in case there should be any hostile demonstration,
that Lord Slava, with his men, came swarming
into the arena, and gave a loud command.</p>

<p>The soldiers who had been under the dominion of
Calaman were merely hirelings, and when they saw that
the death of the Golden Scarab appeared to mean the
overthrow of the men who had for so long been the
rulers, they were eager to flock to the new leader’s
standard.</p>

<p>So they rushed to the gates which held back the intended
victims of the Golden Scarab and flung them wide
open.</p>

<p>Out poured a number of prisoners, blinking in the
sunlight, and most of them wondering what it was all
about.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a wild shout of delight, and a sobbing,
hysterical laugh. Jefferson Arnold dashed across the wide
space and flung his arms around a young man who was
carrying a woman in his arms.</p>

<p>“Leslie!”</p>

<p>“Dad!”</p>

<p>“Is it you? My boy?”</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold seemed as if he could not realize that
he again had his son back, and he squeezed Leslie without
noticing that he held a young woman in his arms.</p>

<p>“Mind the lady, dad!” laughed Leslie. “She’s not very
strong, and you have a hug like a grizzly bear.”</p>

<p>“Put her down, Leslie!” returned the millionaire. “What
is the matter with her? Poor thing! She looks dazed.”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” said Leslie. “She was to have been the
next one given to the Golden Scarab. You’ve managed
to save her somehow, but I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“Carter did it!” answered Jefferson. “He’s killed the
thing. Can’t you give that poor girl to somebody to take
care of, and come over here? You know, my boy,” he
whispered, in a grave tone, “I don’t know whether we are
out of this infernal trap yet. I hope we are, but I’m not
sure.”</p>

<p>Just then Nick Carter came running up, with a rifle
in his hand. He gave the weapon to Leslie, together with
a handful of cartridges.</p>

<p>“There you are, old man!” he said hurriedly. “Use that
if you have to. I have an automatic and a few cartridges
in my pocket, so I don’t need the rifle. Pass the girl
to somebody and come over here.”</p>

<p>Leslie Carter beckoned to one of Lord Slava’s men,
and put the young woman in his charge.</p>

<p>“Take care of her. It’s Lord Slava’s orders,” he said.</p>

<p>This was not the absolute truth, but Leslie felt sure
Slava would agree when he was told.</p>

<p>“Ready, Leslie!” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Quite!”</p>

<p>“Come on, then!”</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold had a rifle in his hand, and, with his
son by his side, felt that he could defy the whole of
Shangore. He grinned like a schoolboy as he slapped
Leslie on the back and rushed forward to help his friends
on the other side of the arena.</p>

<p>Now that they had accomplished the purpose for which
they had come, the rescue of Leslie Arnold, Nick Carter
and his friends would have been content to go out of
the city.</p>

<p>But there was work to be done for the man who had
given them their first chance to overcome the Golden
Scarab and save Leslie, by releasing them from their
dungeon—Lord Slava.</p>

<p>With his soldiers at his back, he met the first rush
of Calaman’s forces. Nick Carter, Chick, Patsy, and the
others were with him, and they sent in a volley at close
quarters that did terrible execution.</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold shot down three of the guards, and
Chick accounted for two more. As for Patsy, he did not
know how many he got. He just pumped bullets at the
enemy with the same cheerful earnestness with which he
did everything that came in the line of duty.</p>

<p>Calaman rushed forward with his men, wielding a long
knife.</p>

<p>As has been remarked already, the old priest was no
coward. He was willing to take all the risks that might
be encountered by his men, and he fought like a demon
until he was laid low.</p>

<p>It was Lord Slava who killed Calaman with a slash
of his sword, after he had parried a venomous cut the
priest made at him with his wicked-looking knife.</p>

<p>With the death of Calaman, it seemed as if all the opposition
to Slava melted away.</p>

<p>The followers of Calaman fled in all directions. They
were chased ruthlessly by the ordinary people whom they
had tyrannized over for years, and if there were some
excessive cruelties by the indignant populace now that
they held the upper hand, it is not a cause for much
wonder.</p>

<p>“Say, chief,” whispered Patsy to Nick Carter, “have
you found out what that big gold bug really is?”</p>

<p>“No, Patsy. I have been too busy helping Lord Slava.
His trouble is about over now, however, and I have
a little time to look over my late enemy. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Still lying over there, where you knocked it,” was
Patsy’s reply. “It’s a wonder somebody didn’t drag it
away, like they did the poor wretches it killed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick Carter, Chick, and Patsy all went over to examine
the carcass of the Golden Scarab.</p>

<p>“Just what I thought,” muttered Nick, as he knelt by
the side of it. “I was pretty certain this was the
game?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>The detective took his heavy jackknife from his pocket,
and, without ceremony, ripped open the monster with one
long slash.</p>

<p>The Golden Scarab was not a real beetle!</p>

<p>Its form was built of fine steel bands and bamboo,
and over it was stretched a network of fine-meshed steel.
It was a miracle of skill. The steel network made a
foundation for heavy scales like those of a fish, made
of pure gold.</p>

<p>Besides this covering, there was a quantity of intricate
mechanism, by which the pretended beetle could be moved
in any way that might have been possible to a live one.</p>

<p>Inside the case Nick Carter found three dead men.
They had been the moving spirits of the thing, and that
they had done their work well was proved by the fact
that few people doubted the reality of the Golden Scarab.</p>

<p>“I didn’t take any stock in it,” declared Patsy. “You
couldn’t tell me a thing like that was alive.”</p>

<p>“It was alive in a sense,” corrected Chick.</p>

<p>“Well, you know what I mean,” grunted Patsy. “How
did these men work it, chief?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t any of the men alive?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“No. They have all paid the penalty of their villainy,”
was Nick Carter’s reply. “I cannot say that I am sorry.
They would have killed Leslie Arnold if we had not come
in time to stop the performance.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. They got just what they deserved,” declared
Patsy, with decided vigor.</p>

<p>“And that poor young woman was to have gone first
of all,” added Chick. “I wonder if she knows that her
husband is dead.”</p>

<p>“We won’t tell her, at all events,” said Nick. “Let me
look over these fellows in the Scarab, and see what killed
them. Two of them were caught by the spear. That’s
plain enough.”</p>


<p>“This other one, in the head of the beast, has a bullet
hole in his forehead,” announced Chick.</p>

<p>“He was the one who worked the horns and caught
the victims in the poisoned knives. What an unmitigated
set of ruffians they were. They were under the domination
of Calaman, of course. But, if they had not been evilly
inclined to begin with, he would have known that they
would not serve him in this way.”</p>

<p>“Calaman knew his men. You can bet on that,” remarked
Patsy, with conviction.</p>

<p>Nick Carter did not reply. He was examining the
mechanism of the horns.</p>

<p>He found that they were hollow, and that they were
jointed, like those of a lobster, to give free play to an
inward thrust.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get this fellow out before we can investigate
properly,” observed Nick. “Lend me a hand,
Patsy!”</p>

<p>Between them, they dragged out by the heels the man
who had worked the head of the Scarab. His arms had
been fitted into the hollow horns, and in each hand was
a long, curving, narrow-bladed knife, with a very sharp
point.</p>

<p>These knives formed the points of the horns, and were
charged with a deadly poison.</p>

<p>The poison was concealed in the handles of the knives,
the blades of which were hollow, so that the deadly stuff
would run through and empty into a wound made by
the weapon.</p>

<p>The knives were gilded to look like part of the Scarab’s
claws, the whole work being completed with the skill
that marked everything done under the guidance of Calaman
and his colleagues.</p>

<p>“I always suspected that the Golden Scarab worked
in this way,” put in the deep voice of Lord Slava behind
them. “I never knew till now. Well, this is the end of
that kind of thing.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter got up and saw that Lord Slava was accompanied
by a dozen or so more of men of dignified mien,
and he understood that the trouble with Calaman’s guards
was over.</p>

<p>“Where are all the soldiers that were so bent on killing
you and your people a few minutes ago?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“A few of them are dead,” replied Slava, with a shrug.
“But most of them have gone to their quarters, to remain
there till they are summoned to the palace.”</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of Lord Slava’s mouth,
when the sound of tramping feet on the sand made them
all turn around.</p>

<p>There was a loud shout of angry men, and the next
moment the little party around the remains of the Golden
Scarab found themselves in the midst of as hot an affray
as the average man could possibly desire.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>NICK HANDS BACK A RELIC.</small></h2>


<p>“Beat them back, boys! It’s only a bluff!” shouted
the voice of Leslie Arnold, from somewhere in the middle
of the invaders.</p>

<p>“Look out!” bellowed Jefferson. “They’ve got my boy
again! Carter, I depend on you!”</p>

<p>This was an unnecessary reminder. Nick had seen at
a glance what the trouble was all about, and he hurled
himself into the thick of the fighting with a vigor that
sent half a dozen men reeling from him on either side.</p>

<p>As the detective thus made a way for himself, using
only his fists, Leslie Arnold broke away from two gigantic
men in the uniform of Calaman’s guards.</p>

<p>“Lend me a gun, somebody!” shouted Leslie. “They’ve
grabbed mine away from me! A rifle, or pistol—anything
that will shoot!”</p>

<p>But Nick Carter merely caught the young fellow by
the hand, and, with a tremendous yank, dragged him away
from the men who had been holding him.</p>

<p>The result of the pull was that Leslie came staggering
forward, and was caught in the arms of his indignant
father.</p>

<p>By this time Nick Carter had drawn his automatic revolver
and was pointing it at the head of the foremost
of the two men who had held Leslie Arnold.</p>

<p>The fellow knew enough of the power of the mysterious
“death stick” to be in dread even of a little one.
As he saw the stern face behind the revolver and watched
the gently moving finger on the trigger, his mouth opened
in terror and he let his long spear fall to the ground.</p>

<p>His companion, faced by a rifle in the hand of Chick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
also let his spear sink into the sand at his feet, while
their followers, some twenty strong, seemed ready to give
up their weapons at the word of command.</p>

<p>“Stand!” roared Lord Slava, in a voice of thunder.
“Who are you?”</p>

<p>The two leaders were wise in their way, and they had
gathered enough of the trend of affairs in the last minute
to understand that there had been a great change in the
government of Shangore—which, in effect, meant all
Bolongu.</p>

<p>They were assisted to this conclusion by the spectacle
of the dead Calaman, who was being carried away by
two men with no more respect than had been shown to
the remains of the men killed by the Golden Scarab half
an hour before.</p>

<p>“We <em>were</em> guards of the high priest Calaman,” was the
reply of one of the men, with a decided emphasis on the
word “were.” “We are now whatever my lord desires.”</p>

<p>Lord Slava grinned at Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“What do you think of these men?” he asked, in a low
tone. “They were seemingly loyal to Calaman. But they
are mine now—until somebody takes my power from me.
Well, one must use what material comes to his hand.
These men are no worse than most others in Shangore.
They have been so oppressed for years that one cannot
wonder they are truckling and time-serving.”</p>

<p>“What were they doing with my friend Leslie Arnold?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“We had been told by Calaman to take care of him if
he escaped the Golden Scarab,” said one of the two men.
“We did not know that Calaman was dead, and we were
obeying orders.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like Calaman,” remarked Lord Slava. “If,
by any chance, this young white man, Leslie, had beaten
the Golden Scarab, then he was to be put to death in some
other way. I’m glad Calaman is dead.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” roared Jefferson Arnold. “Because it saves
me the trouble of killing him. I would have done it
right now, if somebody else hadn’t done it first.”</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” said Lord Slava, “I think everything
is safe now. By the way, there are four servants of
yours, who carried your baggage, waiting in the palace.
I had them there, feeling sure that we should be victorious
in what we have just now attempted, and I knew you
would want your men. I have been appointed provisional
governor of Shangore. You will dine with me to-night
at the palace, will you not?”</p>

<p>Nick Carter willingly accepted the invitation on behalf
of his companions, as well as himself, and then started
out for a stroll about Shangore, with only Chick, Patsy,
and Captain for company.</p>

<p>“I’ve always been saddled with old Calaman before when
I looked over the city,” he remarked. “It will be pleasant
to go where we please and see what we please, without
that old rascal always on the watch.”</p>

<p>The dinner that evening at the palace was well served,
and Lord Slava made a noble figure at the head of the
table, as the host.</p>

<p>There were fifty people at the great board, most of
them of noble blood and resembling in a general way
Lord Slava himself.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had the place of honor on the right of
the host, with Chick on his left. Close by were the two
Arnolds and Patsy Garvan. The white men declared afterward
that they never had sat at a pleasanter dinner table.</p>

<p>It was proved that the educated inhabitants of Shangore
were full of wit and a certain delicate humor that would
have done credit to New York, Boston, or Philadelphia,
not to leave out Chicago and San Francisco.</p>

<p>“Say, chief,” whispered Patsy, after a particularly good
story by Lord Slava, “we haven’t got anything on these
people at our swell public dinners in New York, have
we?”</p>

<p>“The after-dinner speaker and story-teller is not peculiar
to any age or clime,” laughed Nick Carter. “I hope they
are taking care of Jai Singh and Adil through all this.”</p>

<p>“They are dining with my principal officers in an adjoining
hall,” volunteered Lord Slava, who had overheard the
remark of his guest. “We owe a great deal to Jai Singh.
We must not forget that he wanted to take up the challenge
of the Golden Scarab. It was only the detestable
meanness and pretense of Calaman that prevented his doing
the work that fell to you, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly feel bitter against Calaman for that,”
laughed Nick. “I had an experience in that arena which
was entirely new to me, and I must confess that I enjoy
new sensations.”</p>

<p>There was more talk and jollity over various things,
and then Nick Carter got to his feet, and in a speech
that Patsy afterward said was a bully one, thanked Lord
Slava for his assistance in rescuing Leslie Arnold, winding
up by requesting him to accept the rifle that had killed
the head of the Golden Scarab and had helped to bring
a better government to Shangore.</p>

<p>The rifle was accepted with thanks, and after the dinner
Nick Carter gave Lord Slava a few lessons in handling it.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, three days later, the party of white
men, with their four coolies carrying provisions, and with
Jai Singh and Adil leading the way, departed for the
mountain pass that would be their first stage on the
way home.</p>

<p>Lord Slava sent an escort of a hundred men to get
them through the pass, after loading the four coolies
with presents for their employers.</p>

<p>These presents were mostly in the shape of jewels and
golden ornaments, so that they were not very heavy, although
the coolies were so loyal to Nick Carter that they
would not have complained if they had had to carry much
more than they did.</p>

<p>Slava had been chosen permanent governor of Shangore,
and there was great rejoicing all through the Bolongu
country, as well as in the city.</p>

<p>Before the soldiers who had brought them to the pass
went back, Leslie Arnold and his father had a rather
lengthy confab apart from the rest of their party.</p>

<p>“I want to send something back to Lord Slava,” said
Leslie. “If it had not been for him, I shouldn’t be here
now, in all probability. With Carter and you shut up in
that dungeon, what chance would you have had of getting
at me before that devilish beetle contrivance poisoned me
to death?”</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold shuddered. He knew too well how
near he had come to losing his only son.</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Leslie,” he assented. “But what
can we give to Slava? The man has more gold and silver
and precious stones than he wants, as it is. I don’t know
what we can give him that he would care for.”</p>

<p>“He would appreciate the sentiment of gratitude that
prompted us, at all events,” returned the young man.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Leslie,” grunted his father. “But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
should like our sentiment to take a form that would
please him outside of that. Wait a minute. We’ll ask——Hello,
Carter!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Come over here. We want to ask you something.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter strolled over to the two Arnolds and gave
them a good-humored nod.</p>

<p>“Go ahead! What’s the difficulty?”</p>

<p>In a few words Leslie Arnold explained what they
wanted to do, and the quandary they were in as to how
to do it.</p>

<p>“We should like to present Lord Slava with something
he would like to possess, and at the same time make
him understand in some tangible way how grateful we
are.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter reflected for a few minutes. Suddenly he
exclaimed, in a tone of conviction, as he slapped his right
fist into the palm of his other hand:</p>

<p>“I believe I have it!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Jefferson Arnold. “Something that he
would like to have, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I do mean,” replied the detective.
“Moreover, I have it right here, in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“A photograph of yourself?”</p>

<p>“No. Not exactly,” smiled Nick Carter. “I don’t suppose
he’d care for that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you there,” dissented Leslie. “But
what is it you have?”</p>

<p>Nick dived into one of his coat pockets and brought
out a round object wrapped in a cloth.</p>

<p>“Here is something that I am sure Lord Slava would
like to have. In fact, I consider it belongs to him more
than to any one else. I took it to keep as a memento
of this trip through India and of the people of the Land
of the Golden Scarab. But I willingly give it up.”</p>

<p>He unrolled the cloth, and held up the shriveled head
he had taken from the cavern of the old witch doctor
whom they had surprised hanging over a brazier and
caldron more than a week before.</p>

<p>Jefferson Arnold and his son both backed away and
looked incredulously at Nick Carter—disgustedly, in fact.</p>

<p>“What in thunder would he want such a thing as that
for?” roared Jefferson. “I can’t bear to look at it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But don’t forget that this is the head
of Prince Tillo, an uncle of Lord Slava’s. Different people
have different ideas, my dear Arnold,” continued Nick
Carter impressively. “I believe that if Lord Slava had
this mummified head to hang in the temple at Shangore,
he would be better pleased than with anything else you
could give him. Suppose you ask the captain of his
guard over there.”</p>

<p>After some persuasion, Jefferson Arnold followed Nick’s
advice. The eagerness with which the soldier took the
grisly relic told them they had hit on the right thing.</p>

<p>“Lord Slava would have given many jewels for this,”
he said. “May I take it to him?”</p>

<p>“You certainly may,” answered Jefferson, trying to hide
a grimace of disgust. “With my compliments, and the
gratitude of both my son and myself.”</p>

<p class="asterism">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was three months later, when Nick Carter and his
two assistants sat in the handsome library in Nick Carter’s
home in Madison Avenue, New York, that the detective
asked Patsy what the little three-cornered plate of
gold was that he had seen in his hand the night before.</p>

<p>Patsy grinned.</p>

<p>“It is a relic of our trip into Shangore, in the Himalayas,”
he replied. “I grabbed it before we left that amphitheater
after all the fuss. I found it in the sand.”</p>

<p>“Well, but what is it?”</p>

<p>“Only one of the scales from the Golden Scarab. I was
going to have it mounted in a frame, to hang up in the
library. It was to be a present to you from Chick and
myself.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to accept it,” smiled Nick Carter.
“It will help me to realize, when I look at it, that all that
adventure in Shangore was not a dream.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>AN ADDED DISCOVERY.</small></h3>


<p>After supper in the main shack with the others of the
constructing force, Nash sought the seclusion of his own
little cabin. His trunks had been brought up from San
Fernando several days earlier, but until now he had not
had time to unpack them. The cabin had but one room,
and this he decorated with some photographs, magazine
prints, and some articles of a personal interest.</p>

<p>He made an old box into a bookcase, and upon the
shelves arrayed his treasured volumes. These were principally
books on engineering and travel, although scattered
among them might be found a favorite adventure story
or two, several bound collections of verse, and a bulky
dictionary. To the books of poetry he added the copy
belonging to the vagrant he had met that memorable day
in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>“A down-and-outer with a batch of Kipling’s ballads,”
he muttered to himself, as he picked the book from his
trunk. “That’s a contrast for you.” He sat down before
the improvised bookcase and read through some of the
swinging verse. “Better than a tonic,” he murmured
later, looking at the clock and discovering he had been
lost for nearly two hours. “I don’t think that vag ever
owned this book. Probably found it in the park, or lifted
it from a pocket. I wonder if he——”</p>

<p>He stopped so abruptly that an observer might have
thought a hand had gripped his throat. A strange, unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
thrill raced up his spine; his eyes remained glued
to the half-blank page he had inadvertently turned.</p>

<p>There, across the white space, in a thin, angular hand,
was written: “To Walter Trask, from his Sister Ethel.
Christmas, 1911.”</p>

<p>For a minute Nash stared at the writing, his thoughts
galloping far away—far beyond the miles of mountain
ranges, beyond the limitless stretch of prairie, where,
for the moment, he lived over again that black hour in the
bunk house. Mentally he recalled the shouts, the questioning
voices, the sharp crack of a revolver fired in the
closed room. Then the mêlée of fists—the still, deathlike
face of the man on the floor——</p>

<p>Nash drew in a deep breath and passed a quick hand
across his eyes. “What a small world it is, after all!”
he reflected. This little volume, picked from the pocket
of an unfortunate, had belonged to Walter Trask. What
strange trick of Destiny had willed it here, in Nash’s
hands?</p>

<p>He closed the book and placed it among the others.
“I wonder,” he said aloud, staring ahead of him with
unseeing eyes, “how it is all to end? There’s a little
rhyme somewhere—Kipling’s, too—that reads: ‘The sins
men do, two by two, come back to them one by one.’”</p>

<p>He got into bed that night with a solemn resolution
to banish forever the past from his thoughts. The things
that had happened were buried, and all the post-mortem
examinations ever devised would not help matters.</p>

<p>Here he was to-day, with a shoulder to the wheel, his
quota of strength helping, with the thousand others, to
push to completion this wonderful aqueduct that the City
of Angels might be supplied with cold, crystal-clear water
from the realms of eternal snow. The immensity and
daring of the project thrilled him; day by day it grew;
day by day he gloried in the thought that he was to
contribute a mite toward the great achievement.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>GETTING ACQUAINTED.</small></h3>


<p>Nash accepted his new responsibilities in a manner that
won him instant favor, not alone from his superiors, but
from the men under him—the motley siftings of many
races. And in turn Nash interested himself in their
welfare. Knowing that as a chain is only as strong as
its weakest link, so he knew that a body of men, striving
for one end, must, work collectively and without friction
to reach that goal.</p>

<p>In the beginning, he determined upon a certain amount
of work to be completed in a daily shift. He took the
men into his confidence—made them feel a part of his responsibility—encouraged
them to strike a record and never
fall short of it. Nor was it an easy victory, this final
whipping into line—with kindness and consideration instead
of the usual oaths and doubled fists—of the passive
Hindus, the silent, stolid-faced Japs, the crafty, catlike
Mexicans, and the cheerful, singing Italians. But
it was accomplished, and in time Nash became known as
possessing the best working crew on the length of the
aqueduct.</p>

<p>Hooker said to him one day: “Nash, you’re doing
more work and better work with half the number of
men than Macmillan did with a full crew—and in a
third the time. There’s a hundred-dollar bonus coming
to you for last month’s construction.”</p>

<p>The aqueduct being a municipal undertaking, the city
of Los Angeles awarded a bonus each month to the foreman
under whose direction more than the average amount
of work was done. The thought that his gang had won
out over all the others on the whole construction was a
feather in Nash’s cap, and he felt as proud as though
he had won a million. When the money was presented
to him, he took it and distributed the sum among the
men. Encouraged by this gift, they won for him the
bonus during the following two months.</p>

<p>During all this period, devoting every thought to his
work, Nash was irritated by Hooker’s peculiar manner—his
sly questioning, veiled suggestions, and his continual
drunken sprees. While no liquor was allowed in any
of the camps, the foreman kept his own cabin well
stocked, and when a man wanted a drink he knew just
where to get it.</p>

<p>Realizing the exposure which would surely come, Nash
spoke to the foreman about it, but gained nothing more
than a wink and a slap on the back.</p>

<p>“What the devil, Nash!” he would say. “A man’s
got to have a little recreation. I’m built for so much
work and so much play. Nothing like a little redeye
to cheer a fellow up. Blamed sorry you won’t join in
the fun.”</p>

<p>“It’s against the city regulations,” Nash said. “The
inspectors will get wise one of these days. Then your
head will go in the basket.”</p>

<p>But Hooker waved aside all the arguments. “I’m
running Camp Forty-seven, Nash, and I’m pretty particular
as to who I’m treating. Besides, Sigsbee knows
just what is going on—and he looks the other way.
Oh, Sigsbee is a live one, he is.”</p>

<p>The mention of Sigsbee’s name brought a flood of
recollections upon Nash. Hitherto he had fought shy
of this man—the mysterious person who had signed the
letter that gained him his position—not because he was
afraid, but because he did not care to muddle up the
affair should it come to answering questions.</p>

<p>Hooker took it for granted that Nash knew Sigsbee, and
all his conversation was based on this fact. Many a
time Nash was puzzled as to the proper answer to give
when the subject was brought up, but so far had managed
very nicely to thwart any suspicion which the foreman
might have entertained. That it could not last forever,
Nash knew well enough; but how it was to end,
and where, and at what cost, was beyond the horizon.</p>

<p>Being on intimate terms with Hooker, Nash marveled
at the system that prevailed in the matter of engaging
help. The newcomer stood no chance in the world unless
he brought with him a note signed with that magic name
of Sigsbee. The common laborers, however, were the
one exception to this ironbound rule.</p>

<p>With the foreman, it was: “Sigsbee wants this,” and
“Sigsbee wouldn’t stand for that,” and very often “Sigsbee
is the live wire on this aqueduct deal.” Sometimes
he was referred to as “the old man.”</p>

<p>One evening, while visiting in Hooker’s cabin and
checking up some of the work already completed, the
foreman handed a newspaper to Nash.</p>

<p>“The old man’s getting to be a real sport,” he said,
laughing. “Look what the Los Angeles <em>Times</em> has to
say about his dinner party.”</p>

<p>Nash read the item:</p>

<p>“A novel and delightful slumming party was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
last night in honor of the eldest daughter of Jim Sigsbee,
the well-known politician. The party of thirty were
taken through Chinatown and afterward enjoyed a supper
in the underground quarters of Sing Foo, the Chinese
mayor. To add to the novelty, the guests were taken in
automobiles to Long Beach, where the braver members
indulged in a midnight swim.”</p>

<p>Nash joined in the foreman’s laugh. “Society in the
West is getting as hard up for novelties as the crowd
at Newport,” he ventured, returning the paper.</p>

<p>Later, however, as he bid Hooker good night and
strolled slowly across to his own shack, he had drawn
one conclusion that started him on the right path, at
least.</p>

<p>“Sigsbee is a well-known Los Angeles politician,” he
told himself, quoting the line from the newspaper item.
“And his family stands well in society. The question is
now: What has he to do with Camp Forty-seven?”</p>

<p>Nash let himself into the shack, and, divesting himself
of some of his clothes, sat down beside the window and
took in the view of the valley. The brilliant moonlight
flooded the land with silver.</p>

<p>“The aqueduct is a municipal affair,” he replied, bringing
up all the facts in the case. “Sigsbee is a prominent
politician. Engages personally all the better class of
help on Camp Forty-seven. All the bills are paid from
the Los Angeles treasury.”</p>

<p>A sudden idea flashed over him, but it seemed so
preposterous that he laughed it away.</p>

<p>“I can’t afford to worry too much about Sigsbee,” he
said. “I’ll do the best I know how with the job I have,
and if it comes to a show-down, I’ll confess the truth
about the letter.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>ON THE FIFTEENTH.</small></h3>


<p>For several weeks after this, things ran on smoothly.
Nash progressed swiftly with his work, the usual perfect
California weather prevailed, and Hooker remained
sober.</p>

<p>One day the foreman left for Los Angeles on business,
returning the same evening. The moment he caught
sight of him, Nash’s heart sank. Hooker was so intoxicated
that two of the office employees had to carry
him from the wagon to his cabin.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to cut out this sort of
thing,” Nash said, helping the foreman into the room.</p>

<p>“Well—I jus’ couldn’t help it,” struggled Hooker. “I
was—in town all—day. Saw—saw Sigsbee. We—had a
glorious—time—so—so pleasant, the old man—is.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what day of the month this is?” asked
Nash.</p>

<p>“Day of—the month?” repeated Hooker, smiling and
shaking his head. “Sure—sure I do! It’s—Monday, ain’t
it?”</p>

<p>“It’s the fifteenth, too. You know what that means,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Fifteenth?” Hooker lifted his head, making a futile
attempt to hold it steady. “What’s—that——”</p>

<p>“This is inspection day, Hooker. You knew it. The
city inspector is below, in Forty-six. He’ll be here in
another hour. You’ve got to brace up. Understand me?
I’ll make you some hot coffee, and you take it down
black.”</p>

<p>“’S’all right,” the foreman gulped. “Don’t worry. I’m—I’m
not drunk. I’ve fooled ’em before—sure I have.”
His head fell back upon the pillow, and he mumbled
something to himself.</p>

<p>“If they find you in this condition, you know what
it’ll mean, Hooker.”</p>

<p>Nash busied himself right away, leaving the foreman
in charge of another man, while he hurried over to the
kitchen and got a can of strong, black coffee.</p>

<p>“Get this down, Hooker,” he commanded firmly.</p>

<p>The foreman, who apparently had aroused himself to
the necessity of immediate action, took a deep draft of
the coffee.</p>

<p>“Ah-h!” he breathed finally. “That’s good. I’ll—be all—right.
Jus’ let me—sleep for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>He fell asleep at once. Meanwhile, Nash joined the
supper crowd, ate his meal in silence, and promptly returned
to where the foreman was slumbering.</p>

<p>The city inspector put in an appearance at eight o’clock,
driving down from Camp Forty-six. Warned of his
coming, Nash attempted to arouse Hooker, but failed
absolutely. The foreman was dead to the world. Nash
was always a quick thinker, but at this particular instant
his brain worked at double time.</p>

<p>The inspector always examined the books of the camp,
checked off the supplies, the pay roll, and the expense
account, taking duplicate copies into Los Angeles. Hooker
had always attended to this, being in full charge of the
camp. Now, with the foreman in a drunken sleep, there
was but one thing to do—and Nash set out to accomplish
it.</p>

<p>He admitted the inspector to the large room in front,
which served as an office.</p>

<p>“Where’s Hooker?” was the first question of the inspector.</p>

<p>“Very sorry, sir, but the foreman isn’t at all well,”
Nash explained. “Has been under the weather all day,
and just an hour or so ago we got him asleep. I don’t
think there will be any necessity of calling him. I can
check over the lists with you.”</p>

<p>“Not just the usual thing to do,” snapped the inspector
irritably. “But I guess it’s the only way out of
the difficulty. Besides, I want to drive on down to
Forty-five before midnight—so we may as well begin.”</p>

<p>He removed his hat and coat, while Nash brought out
the books and the voucher files and the pay roll. These
the inspector went over critically and with a speed that
suggested years of experience in similar work. When
he came to a snag, Nash helped him out. Nash was
surprised at his own familiarity with the details of
construction, and more than once the inspector turned
upon him a sharp, quizzical glance.</p>

<p>Finally, after checking over an endless row of figures,
the man said: “What’s your position here?”</p>

<p>“I’m subforeman under Mr. Hooker.”</p>

<p>“Duties?”</p>

<p>“In charge of the conduit construction.”</p>

<p>The inspector reflected a moment. “Wasn’t that Macmillan’s
position?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Until a month or so ago,” Nash said. “Hooker dismissed
him for incompetency.”</p>

<p>“So?” The inspector frowned, and appeared surprised.
However, he asked no more questions.</p>

<p>“We’ll take the pay rolls now,” he said sharply, lapsing
back into his former impersonal and businesslike way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Nash produced the book and began to call off the
different gangs, the numbers they went under, and the
total wage list each subforeman was responsible for.
He reached his own name, called out the four figures down
on the sheet—then hesitated.</p>

<p>“What’s that again?” asked the inspector.</p>

<p>“Five thousand four hundred and eighty,” Nash read
slowly, still puzzling over the discovery.</p>

<p>“Five thousand four hundred and eighty—O.K.,” repeated
the other. Then, pen suspended in air, he said:</p>

<p>“That’s your own gang, isn’t it? What are you stumbling
over the figures for?”</p>

<p>“I—the figures are blotted. I couldn’t just make them
out,” Nash answered.</p>

<p>The inspector grunted, and called for the next set.
Another hour, and the inspection was over. The city
representative thrust the sheaf of papers into his pocket,
and hurriedly donned his coat and hat.</p>

<p>“Wonder how Hooker is by this time?” he asked.</p>

<p>Nash opened a door in the rear and peered into the
darkened chamber. The inspector pushed past and walked
to the bed.</p>

<p>“Hum-m-m!” he grunted. “He sure sleeps. Guess we
won’t disturb him. Tell him everything’s O.K., will
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Nash responded, thankful that the worst
was over. He followed the man outside to where his
team waited, bid him good night, and watched as the
light buggy disappeared up the cañon road.</p>

<p>After that Nash returned to the office and went through
a certain section of the pay rolls, comparing the added
figures with the ones put down in his own book.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour he tiptoed in, saw that Hooker
was still sleeping; then, blowing out the lamp, he closed
the door and walked slowly over to his own cabin. Sleep,
for the remainder of the night, was an impossibility. The
Unexpected had landed a heavy blow.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>IN THE MORNING.</small></h3>


<p>The next day Hooker was both sober and repentant.
He seemed to remember faintly what had transpired the
night previous; and when Nash had finished breakfast,
he called him aside.</p>

<p>“How did you make out last night, Nash?” he asked
apprehensively. “Did you trip on anything?”</p>

<p>Nash had fully determined to see the foreman the first
thing in the morning, and was glad of this opportunity to
speak of the matter.</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Why, wasn’t old Boyer, the inspector, here?”</p>

<p>“He was.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did you get around the affair? I was dead
to the world, wasn’t I? What did the old crab say?”</p>

<p>“I explained matters as best I could,” Nash answered.
“Said you were ill—which wasn’t a lie—and told him I’d
pitch in and help him on the books.”</p>

<p>“What was the report?”</p>

<p>“He said everything was O.K.”</p>

<p>The foreman breathed a sigh of relief. “Well, that’s
something to be thankful for. You’re a brick, Nash!
You certainly know how to handle some things.”</p>

<p>Nash accepted the praise, such as it was, without replying.
The only thing that had been troubling him since
the inspector’s departure leaped to his tongue.</p>

<p>“Do you know how many men are under me, Hooker?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose so. Don’t you? Don’t the books
show?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the books show—but they don’t balance with mine.”</p>

<p>The foreman allowed a frown to creep around his lips;
his brow wrinkled. “What are you getting at, Nash?”</p>

<p>“I checked off the pay roll to Boyer last night,” Nash
said. “Your books credit my department with something
greater than five thousand dollars. There’s a mistake,
of course. I allowed it to go at the time, because I wasn’t
absolutely certain until I compared the totals with my
own memoranda.”</p>

<p>During their conversation, they had gradually left the
big dining hall and had covered perhaps a quarter of a
mile in the direction of Nash’s operations. This last
remark, delivered in such a matter-of-fact tone by Nash,
brought Hooker to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>“Your memoranda?” exclaimed the foreman. “Say,
what are you driving at, Nash?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to convince myself that those figures on
the pay roll, which the inspector accepted as O.K., are
mistakes—unintentional mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious?” demanded Hooker.</p>

<p>“I certainly am.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that my books are—are off
color?”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to believe it, Hooker,” Nash answered.</p>

<p>The foreman appeared to be dumfounded. “What—what
sort of a memorandum have you been keeping?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“A personal one,” said Nash. “I always believed in
a system. I want to know what each of my men is
accomplishing. I want to know just how much money
I am spending for the city of Los Angeles, and what I
am giving in return. One thing is absolutely certain:
My salary list has never reached half the sum that you
have me credited for.”</p>

<p>Hooker calmly folded his arms and stared at the
speaker. “Nash,” he said, “do you remember what I
said to you the first day we met?”</p>

<p>“I believe it was something about knowing when to
shut my mouth, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I said I admired you because you seemed
to be sensible, because you possessed a valuable asset in
your silence. It seems my ideals are shattered.”</p>

<p>“Hooker,” Nash replied frankly, “I’m a native of Los
Angeles. I love that city, and I’m going to protect its
interests. I haven’t any authority over you, or over your
dealings. I can only concern myself with the things——”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say you were a local man, in the
first place?” interrupted the foreman. “I understood you
came from New York.”</p>

<p>“I did come from there. But I was born and lived
twenty-two years in Los Angeles. I’ve had enough experience
in the engineering line to put me wise to a great
many tricks, Hooker. This isn’t the first time I’ve
bucked up against the same game.”</p>

<p>“Game?” retorted Hooker, his face clouding. “What
the——”</p>

<p>“Yes, game!” Nash snapped out the word. “And padding
the pay roll isn’t a very original one, either.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>THE MYSTERY DEEPENS.</small></h3>


<p>An interruption at this critical moment put an end to
further argument. One of the subforemen, with a roll
of blue prints, engaged Hooker’s attention, and Nash,
aware of the time, and of the fact that considerable work
had to be accomplished that day, abruptly turned away,
leaving the foreman to brood over the dénouement.</p>

<p>Since the discovery last night, Nash had not allowed
the affair to blind him; he had looked at the situation
in the fairest possible light. Coming so abruptly, it
stunned him at first. He had always imagined Hooker,
while quarrelsome and quick-tempered at times, to stand
for what was honorable—especially in a business way.
Even after a careful comparison of the ledger with his
own memorandum, Nash tried to believe that it had
been a mistake—a slip of the pen turning the figure 3
into a 5. He even assured himself that once explained,
the foreman would rectify the error immediately.</p>

<p>It was only now, after the short conversation with
Hooker, that Nash realized the truth. The figures in the
ledger, O.K.’d by the city inspector, were far from
being mistakes; they had been placed there deliberately,
and with but one intent: namely, to defraud the city.</p>

<p>These facts were with Nash the rest of the day, but
he tried hard not to allow them to interfere with his
work. When the screech of the steam shovel sounded
at five o’clock, he finished with the task at hand, saw
that the regular preparations for the night were made,
and then returned to camp, going direct to his shack,
without a glimpse of Hooker.</p>

<p>He was a trifle dubious as to the final outcome of the
affair, and was glad, an hour or so later, when he saw the
foreman coming up the path.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nash!” was the greeting. “How’s the work
progressing?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” Nash answered, wondering at
the other’s tone and manner.</p>

<p>Hooker came in and sat down. He rolled himself a
cigarette and lighted it before going on.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Nash,” he said, “you’re the best man
I’ve ever employed on a job—and I’ve been in the business
twenty years.” He blew out a cloud of smoke and
watched it drift through the open door into the lowering
twilight. “I’m anxious to help you along, too,” Hooker
continued. “I’ve put you down on the list for a raise
in salary.”</p>

<p>Nash leaned back in his chair and gazed quietly into
the other’s partly obscured face.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hooker. I have tried my best to please
you—and the ones higher up. That’s why I called your
attention to the—certain figures in the ledger.”</p>

<p>The foreman turned his face quickly, snatching the
cigarette from between his lips.</p>

<p>“Are you still harping on that?” he demanded irritably.
“I thought we’d settled it this morning.”</p>

<p>“It had only started then,” Nash replied. “I told you—or
meant to tell you—that as long as I was a subforeman
I wouldn’t allow any crooked work to go on in
my department. I don’t know what is going on in the
other divisions; I’m not expected to—but I’m responsible
for the conduit construction work, and it’s got to
be on the level.”</p>

<p>“You’re putting it pretty strong,” Hooker returned, realizing
now that all pretense had to be thrown aside.</p>

<p>“I hope I do. The stronger the better.”</p>

<p>“You’d sacrifice a good job just because your eyes are
too confounded sharp, eh?”</p>

<p>“Put it that way if you will,” Nash said quietly. “I
have no authority over the dozen or more other departments,
but the conduit work, bearing my O.K., must
be clean and aboveboard.”</p>

<p>“See here, Nash,” burst out Hooker, “what’s got into
you? I thought you had sense—I thought you were wise
to some things. Sigsbee must have thought so, or he
wouldn’t have asked me to put you to work. The old
man seldom makes a mistake.”</p>

<p>The mention of that politician’s name sent Nash’s mind
racing again. It was on the tip of his tongue to confess
everything, when a totally new idea swept over him. He
was still considering it when the foreman began talking
again.</p>

<p>“I like you, Nash,” he said. “You’re a good worker,
and in many ways you’ve exceeded my expectations. But
you lack—er—well, we might call it tact.”</p>

<p>Nash smiled. “I think I displayed a little of that
quality when I prevented the inspector from learning the
truth about you last night, Hooker.”</p>

<p>The foreman shrugged. “Of course,” he admitted reluctantly.
“In all probability, you saved me my job—and
I’m grateful. But I hate to see a smart fellow like
you lose out because you’re so—finical.”</p>

<p>“Finical?” Nash delivered the question leaning forward
in his chair, the lines of his strong face set grimly,
resolutely. Hooker’s features were indistinct now in the
gloom; only the red end of his cigarette alternately glowed
and died away. “You know better than that, Hooker.
You’re giving your aid to a piece of dirty work—and
inwardly I’m sure you’re ashamed. I can’t help you.
I’ll leave to-morrow if you say so. I’m on the square,
and I want others to be. This game hits me harder
because it is aimed against the city of my birth. I was
born in Los Angeles, and I’m proud of it. You’re cheating
every one of its three hundred thousand citizens.
They’re building this aqueduct, and they expect every
man to do his duty.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Hooker. “You’re ringing in
sentiment. It always did amuse me the way you natives
blow your own horns. What the devil do you suppose
the city of Los Angeles cares about you? Take it from
me, Nash, sentiment and business don’t mix worth a
cent.”</p>

<p>“Your opinions and mine differ on more than one subject,”
Nash replied dryly.</p>

<p>Hooker tossed away his cigarette with a show of annoyance.</p>

<p>“You’re a mystery to me, Nash,” he declared.</p>

<p>Nash lighted the big lamp on the table before he answered:</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should be. Is it because I——”</p>

<p>A broad, trembling beam of white danced through the
uncurtained window, interrupting his speech. Both men
turned instinctively. Hooker, the nearest to the window,
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That’s an automobile headlight! Now, who do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
suppose would be fool enough to tackle these roads at
this time of night?”</p>

<p>A big machine swept into view by this time, and both
men left the shack and walked toward it.</p>

<p>The car was of the roadster type, and was occupied
by one man, who, instantly he caught sight of Nash and
Hooker, lifted a questioning shout:</p>

<p>“Hello! That you, Hooker?”</p>

<p>Hooker stifled an exclamation, and hurried forward,
Nash following calmly. The man in the car had stepped
out and was talking hurriedly to the foreman. As Nash
came up, standing within the white glow of the twin
headlights, Hooker turned.</p>

<p>“Guess you two gentlemen are acquainted, aren’t you?”
he said, smiling.</p>

<p>Nash looked steadily into the stranger’s face.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ve had the honor,” he answered.</p>

<p>Hooker turned swiftly to the other. “Why, you surely
know Nash, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say as I’ve ever met him before,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>Hooker fell back as if some one had struck him across
the face.</p>

<p>“Do you mean—mean to say,” he stammered, “that you
two have never met before?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s about the size of it,” announced the
stranger.</p>

<p>Hooker was speechless. Nash looked from one to the
other of the men, waiting patiently—not a little curiously,
too—for the introduction that did not come.</p>

<p>Finally, with a shrug of indifference, the stranger turned
back to the machine.</p>

<p>“I’m in a big hurry, Hooker,” he snapped. “I want to
see you right away. Can you spare me a little time?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” the foreman replied dully, as if his mind
was a dozen miles away from the subject.</p>

<p>Realizing that he was the unwelcome third party, Nash
whirled about and went back to his shack. The moment
he was out of hearing, the foreman and the stranger
left the machine standing in the road and walked across
to Hooker’s cabin.</p>

<p>“What the devil’s all this fuss about?” the newcomer
burst out.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain in just a second,” Hooker answered. “I
want to arrange one matter before then.”</p>

<p>They stepped into the big room of the cabin. Hooker
lighted a lamp and pulled down the curtains. Then,
without a word to his visitor, he jerked the receiver
from the telephone and called for a certain person.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he snapped presently, in a hard, tense voice.
“That you, Martin? This is Hooker. Now, listen to
what I’m saying: I want you to come up here immediately.
Understand? I want you to keep an eye on
Nash, and see that he doesn’t try to get away from
the camp. I’m holding you directly responsible. You
must not let him out of your sight until you hear from
me. Get that? And if it comes to a show-down—well,
you know what to do. Remember all of that?”</p>

<p>The response must have been satisfactory, because
Hooker immediately hung up the receiver and turned a
relieved face toward the other occupant of the room.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll explain,” he said.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>THE CRISIS.</small></h3>


<p>The two men, secure in the big, lamp-lighted room,
stared expectantly into one another’s eyes. Hooker was
trembling, his face white, despite the tan. He attempted
to roll a cigarette before beginning, but his fingers refused
to obey. The other man appeared to be more
annoyed than otherwise.</p>

<p>“Do you insist that you never before saw that man
who was with me to-night?” the foreman asked.</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Then how did he happen to have a letter, signed by
you, asking that I give him a position?”</p>

<p>“A letter from me?” The other man—it was Jim
Sigsbee himself—allowed a frown to creep between his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, from you,” affirmed Hooker. “Of course, I didn’t
ask questions. I put him to work. He was a clever man.
He’s now in charge of the conduit construction.”</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“Elliot Nash. At least, that’s what he wanted me to
call him.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the excitement? You look as if you’d
received a ten-year sentence to the pen!”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Hooker, leaning nearer the politician,
his face working strangely in the yellow lamplight, “that’s
just what I want to avoid. That’s why I called up Martin
a minute ago. I wanted to be on the safe side.”</p>

<p>Sigsbee’s interest increased.</p>

<p>“Well, come out with the whole story,” he said. “I
can stand for it. What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“The inspector—Boyer—was here last night. I was—was
ill. Couldn’t see him as usual. Nash happened
around and checked over the books with him.”</p>

<p>Sigsbee was breathing faster now.</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on!”</p>

<p>“This Nash is a systematic chap. Kept a memorandum
of everything in his department. He’s wise to the pay-roll
game.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have allowed him to see——”</p>

<p>“Allowed him?” Hooker interrupted bitterly. “What
else was I to do? Didn’t he have a letter from you?
How was I to know? I thought of course you knew
the man, and that he was wise to things. That’s why I
trusted him in a dozen different ways.”</p>

<p>The politician was beginning to share the foreman’s
uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Did he come to you after he found out about the
pay-roll figures?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. He said he thought at first it was a mistake in
the bookkeeping. I imagined he was joking. When I
found he was serious, I began to get worried.”</p>

<p>“Has he threatened?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. But he intends to resign unless his department
is run on the square. Handed me a bunch of
stuff about being a native of Los Angeles, and how he
dreaded to see its citizens get the little end of the deal.”</p>

<p>“Why not let him resign?” Sigsbee said, after a moment’s
hesitation. “It’ll save explaining, and clear our
minds a bit——”</p>

<p>Hooker broke in angrily: “Look here, Sigsbee, you’re
a sensible man. Hasn’t it occurred to you that possibly
some one suspects our game and has taken this method
of getting the goods on us? We don’t know how Nash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
got that letter, but in all probability it was just a part
of a well-laid scheme. It gave him the opportunity of
working on the job and getting the proofs firsthand.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t looked at it in that light,” Sigsbee said, plainly
affected by the foreman’s statement. “But it sounds
reasonable enough. I’ve been uneasy myself for the past
month or so. There’s something in the air—that ominous
calm before a storm possibly. Somehow, every time
I step into the city hall I expect a hand to descend upon
my shoulder. The evening papers are hinting about the
amount of money being spent. I don’t know where it’ll
all end.”</p>

<p>“I know,” vehemently declared Hooker. “It’ll be a
change of clothes and a State boarding house—all without
cost to us.”</p>

<p>“Things are looking serious, Hooker, but——” Sigsbee
remained buried in thought for the time. Finally he
resumed: “Are you satisfied that Nash is a city spotter?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t all the evidence point that way?”</p>

<p>Sigsbee had to admit it did. “I’d like to know how
he came in possession of my letter,” he went on. “If
he found it and needed a job, and took that method
of obtaining it—we’re still safe. But if it was all a cleverly
worked-out scheme, such as you seem to believe—well,
things look doubtful.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think the news has gone beyond this camp,”
Hooker ventured to hint. “There’s some consolation in
that, eh?”</p>

<p>Sigsbee’s eyes came up swiftly. “You mean we might
prevent him from——” He broke off.</p>

<p>“Why not? Desperate cases demand desperate measures.
It doesn’t seem right that one man should deprive us
of all our reward. Now, if he was only out of the
way——”</p>

<p>“We’re in too deep right now,” the politician broke in.
“What you suggest would only bring the police and the
reporters about us.”</p>

<p>Hooker laughed mirthlessly. “What did I suggest?”</p>

<p>“Why, you said——” the other began.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know, on jobs of this kind, Sigsbee, that
a dozen accidents happen every day? Do you know that
we’ll average a dozen deaths a month right here in this
camp? A steam shovel breaks, or some chain slips, or
maybe there’s a rock slide. If you say the word, I’m sure
Martin could arrange everything.”</p>

<p>“That would be very well,” Sigsbee said, weighing the
matter calmly, “if we were positive of two things: That
Nash is not a spotter, and that he alone knows of our
affairs.”</p>

<p>Hooker walked slowly up and down the room, his
hands clenched at his sides. Sigsbee, huddled in a chair
before the table, watched him narrowly.</p>

<p>“We’ve had smooth sailing for three years,” the foreman
said, at length. “And at the best we could only
have one more year—possibly eighteen months. I’d like
to wash my hands of the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there,” responded Sigsbee. “I’d like to
drop the game—drop it before we’re shown up.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to prevent it?” asked Hooker, pausing
beside the other’s chair. “Why can’t we?”</p>

<p>“We’re in deep—infernally deep,” Sigsbee said gravely.
“I’m afraid they’d trace it back. You know, I haven’t
the best of reputations since that affair in Chinatown.
Once let the rumor get out, and have the newspaper
fellows nosing around——” He paused and shrugged.
“I’ve a family to consider, too. If Nash should meet with
an accident, such as you’ve suggested, how do we know
but there might be a dozen others—friends, possibly,
who’d out with the story? If he’s a spotter, he’s no
fool.”</p>

<p>“Why not pass a little of the long green before his
eyes?” the foreman spoke up swiftly. “Most of us fall
for that.”</p>

<p>But Sigsbee shook his head. For some time he was
steeped in thought, staring across at the opposite wall, his
fat white fingers toying with his watch chain.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose this man would visit me in the city?”
he asked, at length.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” moodily responded Hooker. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Will you ask him to call to-morrow at my office?”</p>

<p>“If you insist. But I tell you, Sigsbee, it’s playing with
fire. One little word from him, and the whole town
would be up in arms. We’ve got him safe as it is.
Martin won’t let him get out of camp. I don’t see why
we want to——”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him at my office to-morrow at two o’clock,”
Sigsbee interrupted, heedless of the other’s protests. “And
as for you, Hooker, maybe I’ll give you the vacation you
wanted.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center xlarge bold p2">SOUND SLEEPERS.</p>


<p class="p2">Mr. Boyle says that it is one of the amusements of
West Africa to show strangers how a Fantee boy can
sleep. A friend of his wishing to rouse some servants
and send them to close the shutters and lock the doors,
said to him:</p>

<p>“I’ll show you something which you wouldn’t believe
on hearsay.”</p>

<p>Thereon he grasped a boy by the heels, dragged him a
yard or so, turned him over, and roughly lifted him to
a sitting posture; the youth sat up, rubbed his eyes,
scratched his head, and went to sleep again. To another
he did the same, with a like result.</p>

<p>Having thus got the two alongside, fast asleep, he
dragged one on top of the other, and left them a moment;
they slumbered placidly in that position. He then ran
amuck at them, being in slippers, and upset the pair,
and ordered them loudly to close the shutters. They both
got up, eyes wide open, and apparently conscious; one
walked gravely downstairs, the other retired, with all
semblance of reason, to the pantry alongside.</p>

<p>The one who went down came up again in two minutes,
still with his eyes wide open, and leisurely
lay down to sleep again; the other we found fast snoozing
in the pantry on a stool. We took them up, and shook
them violently; they rubbed themselves, and went to sleep
again.</p>

<p>Dragging them into the dining room, without a word,
they silently set about their work, fastening shutters and
doors.</p>

<p>“Do you think they are awake?” asked my friend.
“Tell them to get you something.”</p>

<p>I did so. No response. I repeated the order. They
quietly went back, their work completed, and dropped
asleep upon their mats. Fast stupefied with sleep all
the time!</p>

<h2>THE NEWS OF ALL NATIONS.</h2>


<p class="no-indent center bold">Chickens on Spotted Mule.</p>

<p>L.E. Richard, of Game, Mo., has a spotted mule that
is gentle on all occasions. During the cold spell Mr.
Richard’s dozen chickens have been roosting on Maud’s
back. They do this, it is supposed, to keep their feet
warm. The mule wanders around the premises and doesn’t
seem to be annoyed because the chickens prefer to use
him as a roost, and the chickens appear to enjoy their
ride very much.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Stood on His Head in a Barrel.</p>

<p>Major Simon Pratt, a battle-scarred veteran of more
bloody fields than any G.A.R. man in Waldo County, Me.,
who lost part of an ear, two toes, and a thumb, came
near ending his eventful life in a most unsoldierly way.
Although he is seventy-eight years old and weighs more
than 200 pounds, he is able to be of some help around
the place.</p>

<p>He reached into a barrel to get a hen that had nested
in it, and pitched headfirst. His grandson and a chum,
who happened to be near, were not strong enough to get
the major out, but they located a block and tackle near by
and by making a hitch around the veteran’s ankles, succeeded
in hoisting him out.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">“Me No Clare,” Says Sam.</p>

<p>When a gas stove exploded in the kitchen of a Chinese
restaurant in Grand Rapids, Mich., a skillet in which a
cook was frying four eggs was hurled a distance of fifteen
feet across the room, and the handle penetrated a
wall. After the excitement had died down it was found
that the yolks of the eggs in the skillet were unbroken
and the cook, Sam Gee Lee by name, immediately placed
the pan on another blaze and finished the order.</p>

<p>When Sam was asked if he wasn’t scared when the
stove suddenly shot toward the ceiling in countless sections,
he is said to have replied:</p>

<p>“Me cookee on big whale slip. Blig glun go bloom—cr-r-r-up—bloom!
Me no clare. Cookee allee samee. No
cookee, no mon. Sabe?”</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">“Spook” With Claws Disturbs the Town.</p>

<p>The people of Ithan, a suburb of Philadelphia, Pa., have
appealed to the Radnor Township police to rid the community
of a “queer thing,” dressed like a woman, which
prowls about lonely roads late at night and chases
men.</p>

<p>Men who have been chased describe the “queer thing”
as something very spooky. They say it wears black
clothes, a thick, black veil, and has clawlike hands.</p>

<p>Jesse Whitman, who alleges that he was chased one
Tuesday night, described his experience as follows:</p>

<p>“It was about twelve-five a. m., and I was passing
Chandler’s springhouse on Willis Road when it stepped
out from the shadows and stalked along behind me. When
I hurried, it hurried, and when I slowed up, it slowed
up. But it kept getting nearer all the time, and in a
minute I was scared out of a year’s growth.</p>

<p>“The thing came alongside of me and laid one of its
hands on my arm. It gave a kind of grunt and my
hair stood right up straight. It was then that I started
to run, and I kept running for two miles.”</p>


<p>Gypsy Queen’s Body Lies Long in State.</p>

<p>The queen of the gypsies is dead. Lying in a costly
mahogany casket, her body bedecked with jewels and
ancient gold coins, it was being viewed by scores of members
of the nomadic tribe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Callie Mitchell, wife of Emil Mitchell, as the pair
are known in the States, died at Lolita, Ark., and her remains
were taken to Meridian, Miss., to be held until all
the wandering nomads might come to view the body.
Hundreds have arrived so far.</p>

<p>Emil Mitchell, the king of the tribe, came to this country
with his queen from Brazil seventeen years ago, and
his followers, about eighty, were mostly his relatives.
All were Brazilian Indians, and have multiplied numerously
since. When the queen died, long-distance telephone
messages and telegrams were sent broadcast to
all members of the tribe, and now many wagons and
caravans are hurrying to the place to see the last of their
queen.</p>

<p>A general council will decide the burial place, which
will probably be Cleveland, Ohio. No expense is being
spared by the king to make the funeral rival anything
of its kind ever seen before. A solid mahogany casket
contains her body, which is covered with gold coins and
jewels. It is hoped to get every member of the tribe
there in time to view the body before it is sealed up.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Duck Now Acts as Watchman.</p>

<p>David Adington, of Hilliard, Ky., owns a duck that
serves as a watchdog. The duck was hatched with
four legs and soon became a curiosity. When strangers
were in the Adington neighborhood, they would always
visit his place to see the duck. The bird became so
sensitive that whenever it heard any one coming it would
run and hide, but despite its efforts to escape, it was generally
caught.</p>

<p>Then it changed its tactics, and when any one would
approach, it would begin quacking as loud as it could.
Now, when any one enters the back yard at night, the duck
can be heard all over the neighborhood. Adington has
refused several nice sums of money for the duck.</p>

It took Mrs. Gress a year to make the spread.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Kansas Has New Gas Blower.</p>

<p>What is claimed to be the greatest gas well ever developed
in Kansas sprang into record in Augusta. The
flow is estimated at from seventy-five to one hundred
million cubic feet per day. So great is the well that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the cap rock of the gas sand was penetrated, the tools
were blown out of the well several hundred feet into the
air and the derrick was demolished.</p>

<p>The Augusta gas and oil field is being developed rapidly,
and to-day it is second to none in Kansas, and there are
over seventy good gas wells, besides the oil wells which
solve the fuel proposition here.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Horse Plunges Into Store.</p>

<p>Frightened when the cutter became stuck in the street
car tracks, a horse driven by Joseph Cone dashed up the
sidewalk on the main street, in Marquette, Mich., stopped
in front of Stafford’s drug store, snorted a couple of
times, and plunged through the big plate-glass window in
front of the store. Arriving in the store, he gazed
about, showed his teeth in what looked like a grin, then
slowly backed his way out and returned to the street.
The broken window was the only damage resulting from
the episode.</p>

A. Dubel, of Frederick, Md., who believes the bad-luck
jinx has followed him more persistently than any other
man in this country. He must undergo an operation
for a growth on his eye. Recently a growth was removed
from the other eye. His other mishaps since childhood
have been: Left hand almost cut off, right arm broken,
severely scalded, jaw broken, tramped upon by a horse
and three ribs broken, one ear torn off, and a hole pierced
in his head, left foot nearly cut off, kicked by a horse and
leg broken, pinned beneath a 1,500-pound derrick, and

<p>Milton Coats, a seventeen-year-old boy, is at a Marked

due to a fight he had with a mammoth panther.</p>

<p>Young Coats was hunting when the animal leaped from

a baby voice said: “I’s alone. My papa and mamma is
gone, and the stove is turned over. I’s afraid, and I want
you to come out here.”</p>

<p>The firemen found the smoke pouring from the doors of
the home of Andrew H. Stoltz, which was saved by
the presence of mind of his four-year-old boy. How the

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Girl Saves Drowning Man With Her Auto.</p>

<p>A young woman of rare presence of mind, an automobile
tire, a rope, and an automobile worked together to
save the life of a man who was pulled out of a deep pond
just as he was becoming exhausted.</p>

<p>Miss Elsie Ditson, of Paterson, N.J., is the heroine of
the story, while William Young, of Jackson’s Mills, is
the man in the case. Miss Ditson was driving her automobile
through Cedar Grove, near Caldwell, N.J., when
she passed the pond there and heard the shouts of a man
in distress.</p>

<p>She unstrapped an extra tire that she carried along,
fastened to it a rope, and then threw the tire to the
struggling man in the pond. He seized it and she tried
to pull him out, but was unable to do so. Then she tied
the rope to the automobile and started it slowly away from
the pond. The man, clinging to the rope, was hauled
out of the water. Then Miss Ditson took him in her
automobile to the home of her uncle, near by. He
said that he had been skating when the ice broke and
threw him into the water. His efforts to escape were
vain, and he was becoming numb from the cold when his
rescuer appeared.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">His Life Saved by Rubbers.</p>

<p>Because the sloppy condition of the city’s streets caused
him to put on a heavy pair of rubbers, David Taxin, of
Monroe, Mich., is still living. When he drove over some
telephone wires lying on the street and which were crossed
by high-tension wires of the municipal electric plant, his
team of horses dropped dead. Taxin, thinking they had
slipped, got out of the rig and worked over them. Passers-by
warned him he was standing on wires carrying 2,300
volts.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Bird Flies Over the Ocean.</p>

<p>A carrier pigeon dropped from the roof of a building
in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and Fred Jacobs, who found it,
discovered a message tied about the bird’s neck, which evidently
was the message of a German soldier in the Belgium
trenches to his wife. The message read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Wife</span>: I am alive and well in the trenches in
Belgium, but your brother has been killed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was all there was, not even a signature to denote
the identity of the man who wrote this little tragedy of
war. The pigeon showed evidence of long flight, and
the injury to the wing seemed to have been received
shortly before the bird was picked up.</p>

<p>The message was written in English and wrapped in the
heading of a German newspaper, and the date mark of
the paper was Saxony, Dec. ——, the day of the month
missing.</p>

<p>Edward Ell and John Eifert, of Sayville, L.I., gather
clams for a living. In former days they followed the
prosaic method of standing barefoot in the mud and digging
with a spade. But the manner in which they supply
Manhattan restaurants with these popular shellfish at
present is little short of poetry.</p>

<p>They back their small power boats close to the banks
in which the clams dwell. Then they start the propellers
and let them do the dirty work. Every once in a while
they have to reach over and dump a bushel or so of clams
into their boat—but that is unavoidable labor.</p>

<p>Meantime, they lie on cushions and smoke and read.
For perfection only one thing is lacking—a phonograph
to play “This Is the Life,” and business is getting so
good that they threaten to buy one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary Brock, aged 135 years, lives in Shades Valley,
and her grandson, Sam Foley, of Pratt City, Ala.,
intends to give her a party in May. That Mrs. Brock
is the oldest person in the United States is generally
believed, and possibly the oldest in the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brock, according to a statement of Mr. Foley,
was born August 2, 1780, and has lived in Shades Valley
a great many years. Mr. Foley plans to have a birthday
celebration at his home in May, and intends to have
Mrs. Brock present. Mrs. Brock retains her faculties
fairly well. Mr. Foley says:</p>

<p>“Although I have not seen my grandmother in a good

She is in good health and apparently enjoys life in
every way. She has spent the major portion of her life

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Gathers Gold Nuggets in Streets of Town.</p>

<p>Mrs. Guy Talbott, of Grass Valley, Cal., made fifteen
dollars in one day following a heavy storm by mining
in the streets of Grass Valley. While her husband was
working in a quartz mill for two dollars a day, Mrs. Talbot
was picking up nuggets in the street in front of her
home. Other women, many men, and almost all the children
of Grass Valley are now searching the streets for
gold.</p>

<p>The streets of Grass Valley were repaired recently, and
“tailings” or refuse ore from a quartz mine were used
in lieu of cobbles. After an unusually heavy rain, Mrs.
Talbott chanced to see a bit of gold lying exposed in
the street. She abandoned housework for the day and
picked up fifteen dollars’ worth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Talbott tried to keep the secret, but as she could
not mine the streets after dark, it was not long until half
the town was out looking for gold, and finding some,
too.</p>

<p>Grass Valley is not the only city in California paved with
gold. From the records of the city of Marysville it is
shown that on August 12, 1851, Mayor S.M. Miles issued
a proclamation against “the practice of doing mining on
the main street of Marysville.”</p>

<p>He has been a “regular” in the bread line at the Immanuel
Baptist Church, of Chicago, Ill., all winter; his
clothes were tattered and threadbare, and his face showed
the pinch of hunger. The big Sunday-school room of this
Chicago church was crowded to its limits with others in
similar condition awaiting their turn at the tables, where
bread, butter, and coffee are served every morning from
six to eight-thirty o’clock.</p>

<p>Doctor Johnston Myers, pastor of the church, and under
whose direction the “line” gets its daily breakfast,
called the man to the front of the room after he had
swallowed his half a loaf and his two cups of coffee.</p>

<p>“I’m an orphan and I’ve never eaten a meal with a
family,” he said, in response to questions by Doctor
Myers. “I don’t know who my parents were, but I was
put in a New York orphanage when a baby. There I
stayed until I was twelve years old, when I was sent
to a farmer in Canada, to be held until I was of age.
That farmer thought of nothing but how much work
he could get out of me. When my time was up I started
to tramp, and I’ve been at it ever since.</p>

<p>“I’ve eaten at back doors, free-lunch counters, and even
occasionally at a lunch counter in a restaurant, but I’ve

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Want Belgian Linen Makers.</p>

<p>The movement to bring expert linen makers from Belgium
to western Canada, which raises an exceedingly good
grade of flax, is gaining big momentum, and a Belgian
priest is now on his way to Europe after conferring with
the Canadian Northern Railway. The making of linen
had been a large and important industry in Belgium before
the war, but now every factory is closed.</p>

<p>A great many women, as well as men, were employed
in the industry, and the Belgian priest intends to get in
touch with the large manufacturers to induce them to
move their plants and bring as many of their old workmen
as they can to western Canada.</p>

<p>Two points on the Canadian Northern have been under

<p>Old Jim Cassidy, of New York, who drove the Black
Maria laden with prisoners from the Tombs to police
headquarters for years, had his first collapse a day or
two ago. The driver of a patrol wagon did not move away
quickly enough to suit Deputy Sheriff Levy, who shouted
to him. This drew retorts, and old Jim was drawn
into the argument. Soon afterward he keeled over.</p>

<p>Doctor Cox, from St. Vincent’s Hospital, treated the
old man for syncope, and when he revived, he wanted to
get back on the Black Maria, and drive his prisoners, but
his friends forced him into a cab and took him to his

<p>Except for two years of Sheriff Tamsen’s term, Cassidy

Powell’s Valley, by the side of his two wives.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier was eighty-seven years old. He reared

grandchildren and twenty-two great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>“Uncle Lite,” as he was familiarly known, moved to
Wise County sixty-three years ago, and previous to that
he lived in Lee County. Thus he spent his entire life
in the State of Virginia. When he settled in his log
cabin, at the foot of Powell’s Mountain, bear and deer
were plentiful. Norton at that time was a solid growth
of laurel and ivy, and he could have purchased “Prince’s

widow of Sir John Henry Briggs, proposed an international
law prohibiting international marriages.</p>

<p>“Such a law,” said Lady Briggs, “would prevent international

<p>Lady Briggs also suggested that the Women’s Peace
Party undertake to bar naturalization of aliens; to revise
American histories which she declared contain untrue
accounts of the wars with England, and finally to expurge
“sanguinary” lines in the National anthem, declaring the
English were therein referred to as a band of hirelings
and slaves, whose “blood has washed out their foul
footsteps’ pollution.”</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Discipline Saves British from Loss.</p>

<p>If discipline were not now being maintained in the
British army, it would lose, according to P.M. Neilson,
now at the front in France with the First Lowland Company
of Engineers. In a letter received recently by his
sister, Miss Bessie R. Neilson, of Wilkinsburg, Pa., he
tells of several striking instances to show this.</p>

<p>“The Germans made an attack in the night,” he says,
“on the —— Regiment, which took panic, and nearly all,
except two, of their officers fled. Our twenty, however,
under Mr. Clark—one of the officers—who had retreated
a little, came back to a charge. The other two officers
were killed, but our good old Lowland regained the
trenches after very hot work.</p>

<p>“One of the men left to tell the tale of Ypres says he
and a few others saw the Prussians going around the
British wounded, bayoneting them. They could not stand
that, so they charged the Germans, who had three times
as many men. The Germans, as usual, fell back into their
trenches, but the Scotch and English boys pursued them,
and then, of all the cheek in the world! the Germans threw
down their arms and pleaded for mercy. Our fellows
simply shot them all down. Their blood was up.</p>

<p>“Night before last a bullet passed through a box on
which I was leaning, but I have had few exciting times
myself. Two men of a regiment who tried to desert
were killed on the twelfth, after a court-martial, and if
discipline were not now maintained, we would lose.</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible thing, but I’m afraid it will last a long
time. You have no idea what it is like. Our company,
which gets home each night, is luckier than the infantry.
They are in the trenches for days, even weeks, and some
of them don’t know what they are doing. Being there so
long makes them mad. There is no doubt about that. If
you want to speak to them, they just stare at you. They
don’t understand.</p>

<p>“If, at many points, a man is wounded and falls
down, he has to lie there and die in the mud. Should the
medical transport come in time, he will be attended to,
but they can only remove the wounded at night, on account
of the enemy. So that if a man gets wounded at daylight
he has to stay where he is until night.</p>

<p>“Some of our dear old Scotch regiments have been
wiped out. The Black Watch and Camerons have about
ninety-four and one hundred and fifty-eight, respectively,
of above one thousand each. They have been out since
the beginning of the war, and it was at Ypres they suffered
so terribly.”</p>

<p>Although, because of the censor, Mr. Neilson is unable
to tell just where he is, he says the villages have not a
single inhabitant. He describes the beautiful houses, filled
with furniture, now occupied by troops. The people, he
adds, will never return.</p>

<p>“People will tell you the Germans can’t shoot,” he says.
“Well, they have not seen them. They also say one Briton
equals three Germans. There is no difference, and because
of their being taught from infancy regarding militarism,
the German is the better of the two. And by Britons
I mean all the Allies.</p>

<p>“The guns here are booming all day, and an occasional
‘Jack Johnson’ drops around our billet, which is a mile or
so from the actual firing line.”</p>

<p>Mr. Neilson continues that the British are bringing to
the front only their best men, and says the troops are now
supplied with fur jackets and warmers, but remarks that
because of the heavy boots many leave them near the
trenches, as they can hardly carry themselves, not to
speak of ammunition. Even rifles, too, are thrown down.</p>

<p>Under date of Sunday, the twenty-fourth, he adds a
brief postscript:</p>

<p>“The French people here won’t allow any one to sing.
They say it is a time of weeping. All France is the
same, and everybody, or very nearly so, is dressed in
black. So you see I have not heard any singing since
coming to France. Imagine my surprise when just now—this
is what made me write this extra bit—there burst
forth the 100th Psalm. On looking out, I see it is the
Black Watch. Fancy hearing it here! It tones you up
a bit. They are at church parade, and really that is
the best music I have ever heard in all my life, and they
are not good singers.”</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Why Common Powder Smokes.</p>

<p>Ordinary powder produces smoke when fired because
of the quantity of fine particles formed from the breaking
up of the saltpeter and from some of the charcoal
which is not completely burned.</p>

<p>To get rid of smoke, so long a handicap in the use
of guns, it was necessary to produce a substance that
would explode without leaving any solid residue. This
was accomplished by the use of guncotton or nitrocellulose,
from which the most satisfactory smokeless
powder is made.</p>

<p>The substance is a chemical compound, not a mixture
like gunpowder, and is made by treating cotton with
a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids. When exploded,
it is all converted into gases. Burning is not necessary
to cause an explosion, a mere shock or jar being sufficient.</p>

<p>It is too violent an explosive to use in small arms
or in cannon, but guncotton can be made into less forceful
forms, suitable for use in guns, and most brands
of smokeless powder are made in this way.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Bloody Arm His Signal Flag.</p>

<p>Vernon Wilson, a farm hand, was injured while in
the country, near Glenwood, Iowa, in a peculiar way,
and, to get a surgeon, flagged a fast passenger train with
his bloody arm and hand and came to Glenwood.</p>

<p>Wilson was hurt when he dropped some cartridges
from his hand, one falling on a piece of ice and
being discharged. The ball passed through his arm, inflicting
a bad wound.</p>


<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Two Killed in Rail Crash.</p>

<p>James Maxwell, a locomotive engineer of Des Moines,
Iowa, and his fireman, H.L. Hickok, of the same place,
were killed, and Mail Clerk F.M. Perry, of Waterloo,
Iowa, seriously injured in a wreck on the Chicago Great
Western Railroad, three miles north of here. Spreading
rails are believed to have been the cause. All passengers
escaped injury.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
